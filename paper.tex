\begin{abstract}
  We study the possibility for detecting gamma-ray emission in galaxy clusters. We consider 1)
  cosmic ray (CR) induced pion decay which is thought to dominate the astrophysical signal from
  clusters, 2) different representative benchmark models of supersymmetric dark matter (DM), and 3)
  leptophilic models of DM annihilation that recently have been proposed to explain the positron
  excess seen by PAMELA and include a Sommerfeld enhancement of the particle physics cross section
  over its standard value. To model DM annihilation, we consider continuum emission as a result of
  the hadronization of annihilating neutralinos, internal bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton
  emission from the cosmic microwave background as well as from a realistic spatial and spectral
  distribution of dust and stellar light.  After the galactic center, which hosts many astrophysical
  sources, galaxy clusters are the best known target class to detect DM annihilation. We predict
  Virgo and Fornax to be the brightest DM sources and find a particularly low CR induced background
  for Fornax. For a given minimum substructure mass as given by the DM free-streaming scale, one
  needs the largest DM halo mass to maximize the substructure boost over the smoothly distributed
  annihilation flux: for galaxy clusters as the largest collapsed objects, we find a boost factor of
  more than 1000. Since the annihilation flux of substructures is mostly contributed by the regions
  around the virial radius, the resulting surface brightness profiles are almost flat. This makes it
  very challenging to detect this flux with imaging air Cherenkov telescopes since their sensitivity
  drops linearly with radius and they typically encounter have $5-10$ linear resolution elements
  across a cluster; the gamma-ray satellite Fermi is better suited. Assuming cold dark matter with a
  substructure mass distribution down to an Earth mass and using Fermi upper limits, we rule out the
  leptophilic models in their present form in 14 clusters, and limit the boost from Sommerfeld
  enhancement in Fornax to be less than 2 which corresponds to a value in the Milky Way of less than
  5. Alternatively, if the Sommerfeld enhancement factor is realized in Nature, this would imply a
  limiting substructure mass in Fornax of $\mlim > 10^2\,\msun$ corresponding to a Milky Way value
  of $\mlim > 5\times 10^3\,\msun$ which would be a hint for an unknown form of warm dark matter. We
  find that Fermi three-year data will be able to constrain the smallest mass of substructures for
  supersymmetric benchmark models or alternatively constrain their cross sections for a given
  substructure boost. Although the Perseus and Ophiuchus clusters are expected to have the largest
  CR induced flux according to our semi-analytic model that is derived from cosmological
  hydrodynamical cluster simulations, their central active galactic nucleus as well as the Galactic
  foreground makes it hard to detect this flux in the Fermi band. The next to best targets to detect
  the CR flux are Virgo, Coma, and Norma -- the Fermi upper limits are closing in on our predictions
  and will soon start to constrain the underlying CR physics such as shock acceleration efficiencies
  or CR transport properties.

\section{Introduction}

Dark matter has been searched for in direct detection experiments
\cite{Pato:2010zk}, at accelerators
\cite{Ellis:2001hv,Baer:2006ff,Khachatryan:2011tk} and also in
indirect detection experiments looking for signals in the cosmic-ray
spectra of antiprotons, positrons, neutrinos and all of the
electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays
\cite{Bergstrom:2009ib}. So far, the improvements in direct detection
sensitivity have put this method into focus, but the situation may
change considerably the coming few years as the CERN LHC experiments
collect data, and new gamma-ray detectors are being planned, such as
the CTA \cite{Consortium:2010bc}. In fact, it has recently been
pointed out \cite{Bergstrom:2010gh} that a dedicated ground-based
gamma-ray detector would have potential that goes far beyond that of
the other methods, depending on presently unknown parameters in the
particle physics models for dark matter.


Among the astrophysical systems which will be very interesting to
detect, and study, with coming gamma-ray detectors (Fermi, HESS,
MAGIC, VERITAS, and eventually large detectors like CTA) belong galaxy
clusters. The most promising directions in which to search for a
gamma-ray annihilation signal (from the annihilation process itself,
and also the accompanying bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton
components coming from charged particles produced in the annihilations)
are basically three:

1. The galactic centre (g.c.). This is where all numerical simulations
of cold dark matter predict the highest density. However, the detailed
dark matter density in the very central part is difficult to predict,
due a to a possibly very complicated interplay between baryons, dark
matter, and the central galactic black hole. Also, it is a very
crowded region with many gamma-ray sources like pulsars and other
supernova remnants, which have to be subtracted from the data to
extract the dark matter induced signal. In fact, there is a recent
claim of an indication of a relatively light dark matter particle
contribution to the gamma-ray flux from the
g.c. \cite{2010arXiv1010.2752H}, but other hypotheses seem to work at
least as well \cite{2010arXiv1012.5839B}.

2. The dwarf spheroidal galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, like Segue-1,
Ursa Minor, Draco, Sagittarius, Sculptor, Carina or Willman-1
\cite{2009JCAP...01..016B,2010ApJ...720.1174A,2010JCAP...01..031S,2010JCAP...01..031S}. The
problem here is that the nature of many of these small, dark
matter-dominated galaxies is not entirely clear, and the velocity
dispersion estimates are based on rather small numbers of stars. Tidal
disruption and confusion with star clusters are other
complications. Thus the dark matter density profile is very uncertain
for most of them. Nonetheless, by stacking the data together from many
dwarf spheroidals these uncertainties can be made less severe, and
preliminary results from Fermi-LAT shows this method to give quite
promising results \cite{garde}.

3. Galaxy clusters. This possibility has been less studied, however we
noted in a previous Letter \cite{2009PhRvL.103r1302P} that there are
certain advantages that work in favour of this possible target for
gamma-ray detection of dark matter annihilation.  Galaxy clusters
constitute the most massive objects in our Universe that are forming
today. This causes their DM subhalo mass function to be less affected
by tidal stripping compared to galaxy sized halos that formed long
ago.  The annihilation luminosities of the DM halo component for
e.g. the Virgo cluster and the Draco dwarf scales in a way (see
\cite{2009PhRvL.103r1302P}) that the ratio of gamma-ray luminosities
from the smooth components is around 4, in favour of Virgo. In
addition, there may be a further enhancement due to substructure,
which to a large extent should be unaffected by tidal disruption, at
least in the outer regions.  According to a recent estimate
\cite{2011MNRAS.410.2309G}, more massive haloes tend to have a larger
mass fraction in subhalos.  For example, cluster size haloes typically
have 7.5 per cent of the mass within $r_{200}$ in substructures of
fractional mass larger than $10^{-5}$, which is 25 per cent higher
than galactic haloes \footnote{All halo masses and length scales in
  this paper are scaled to the currently favored value of Hubble's
  constant, $H_0 = 70\, \rmn{km~s}^{-1}\,\rmn{Mpc}^{-1}$. We define the
  virial mass $\mvir$ and virial radius $\rvir$ as the mass and radius
  of a sphere enclosing a mean density that is 200 times the critical
  density of the Universe $\rho_{\rmn{cr}}$.}.

For a satellite dwarf galaxy, however, once it is accreted by the
Milky Way, the outer regions are severely affected by tidal
stripping. The longer a satellite has been part of our Galaxy, and the
closer it comes to the center during its pericentral passage, the more
material is removed \cite{2004MNRAS.355..819G}.

In this paper, we will investigate in some more detail the potential
of several of the most promising galaxy clusters to yield an
annihilation gamma-ray yield which could be observable with present
and planned gamma-ray detectors.

\cite{2006A&A...455...21C,2009PhRvD..80b3005J}.

{\bf Anders, insert your flux table for various clusters, and discuss it}

This yields Fornax ($\mvir=10^{14}\,\msun$) and Virgo
($\mvir=2.1\times10^{14}\,\msun$) \del{\cite{}} as the prime targets for DM
observations, Perseus ($\mvir=7.7\times10^{14}\,\msun$) for CR induced emission
and we additionally decide in favor of the well studied cluster Coma
($\mvir=1.4\times10^{15}\,\msun$) for comparison. While studying these four
clusters in great detail, we complement the analysis by calculating the expected
gamma-ray fluxes of a nearby X-ray flux complete sample of galaxy clusters
(HIFLUGCS, \citealt{2002ApJ...567..716R})

\del{In this work we define the virial radius $\rvir$ of a halo to be
  the radius at which the mean density within is a factor $\Delta=200$
  times the critical density $\rhoc$ of the universe.}

This work studies the prospects for detecting extended gamma-ray
emission from galaxy clusters induced by both DM as well as CR
protons. In Section 2 we discuss the theory of DM and gamma-rays. In
particular, we focus one the leptophilic and supersymmetric DM models
used in this work, and outline the framework for estimating the
gamma-ray emission from various radiative processes. In Section 3
we calculate the gamma-ray fluxes and spectral distributions from four
clusters and compare it to upper limits set by Fermi-LAT. For the same
clusters we derive the gamma-ray surface brightness profiles in
Section 4. To extend the analysis to more clusters and find
promising targets we estimate the fluxes from DM and CRs of all
clusters in the extended HIFLUGCS sample in Section 5. In Section
6 we conclude and discuss our results.

\section{Theory}
\label{sect:theory}
We start the section by discussing two different, but well motivated DM models;
leptophilic and supersymmetric DM. We then present the framework that is used to
calculate the gamma-ray emission for these DM models using an Einasto DM density
profile and the expected enhancement from DM substructures. This is followed by
an outline of the framework of inverse Compton emission where we take into
account photon fields of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), dust, and
starlight. We end by summarizing our formalism of calculating the CR-induced
pion decay gamma-ray emission which is thought to dominate the astrophysical
gamma-ray signal.


\subsection{Detecting Particle Dark Matter}
\label{sect:PF}
Besides the intrinsic interest in the gamma-ray flux from galaxy
clusters generated by conventional hadronic and electromagnetic
processes - which should be close to observability with the Fermi-LAT
data \cite{1997ApJ...487..529B,2007A&A...473...41E,2010MNRAS.409..449P}
- the possible contribution from WIMP dark matter is of greatest
interest. A WIMP (Weakly Interactive Massive Particle) which fulfils
the WMAP bounds on the relic density of cold dark matter (CDM) of
\cite{Komatsu:2010fb}
$$\Omega_{CDM}h^2=0.112\pm 0.0056,$$ will in many cases naturally give
a gamma-yield which may be observable. In addition, there are
possible enhancement effects known, such as the astrophysical boost
from dense substructure of dark matter halos, or the particle physics
boost from the Sommerfeld effect, which may increase the chances of
detection further.

There are three methods for detecting dark matter candidates which are
presently employed: First, at particle physics accelerators such as
CERN's LHC, one is now entering into a new energy regime which may
allow the production of the heavy, electrically neutral and long-lived
particles which may constitute dark matter. From these experiments one
may get the first glimpse of the mass scale beyond the standard model
where dark matter may reside. However, to really show that any of the
hypothetical, new particles created at the LHC is actually the dark
matter, one has to rely on the two other methods available for the
dark matter search, namely direct and indirect detection. Direct
detection methods, which are presently evolving rapidly use the feeble
interaction between dark matter particles of the galactic halo
and nuclei such as Germanium, Sodium, Iodine, Argon or Xenon to infer
the scattering cross section and a rough estimate of the mass of the
dark matter particle (for the currently most sensitive search, see
\cite{Aprile:2010um}). A characteristic of this method is that it
basically only depends on the local dark matter density (which is
rather well determined to be around $0.4$ GeV/cm$^3$) and the basic
cross section for dark matter - nucleus scattering. A disadvantage is
that it does benefit from the two enhancement mechanisms mentioned
above, boost from substructure and/or the Sommerfeld effect. Also, it
cannot be excluded - although it seems at present improbable - that
the local halo structure is such that the solar system happens to be
in an underdense region.

In indirect detection, on the other hand, in particular in the photon
channel, one searches for products of dark matter annihilation in the
galactic halo and beyond. Particularly interesting targets are the
galactic center (for a recent possible indication of a signal, see
\cite{Hooper:2010mq}), the dwarf galaxies surrounding the Milky Way
\cite{Strigari:2006rd,Essig:2009jx,2010JCAP...01..031S}, galaxy
clusters (the focus of this work)
\cite{Ghigna:1998vn,Lewis:2002mfa,Boyarsky:2006kc,2006A&A...455...21C,2009PhRvL.103r1302P},
and even the cosmological large scale structure
\cite{Bergstrom:2001jj,Ullio:2002pj,Taylor:2002zd,Elsaesser:2004ap,Cuoco:2010jb,Abazajian:2010sq,Abdo:2010dk,Zavala:2011tt}.

There is also a possibility to search for dark matter annihilation indirectly in
antimatter channels, like antiprotons or positrons. Here diffusion is, however,
very efficient which means that the directional signature which is so important
for gamma-rays, is completely erased. This method has, however, recently been
much in focus due to the surprising rise with energy of the positron-to-total
lepton ratio measured by the PAMELA satellite experiment \cite{Adriani:2008zr}
and the ``bump'' in the total electron plus positron spectrum detected by Fermi
\cite{Abdo:2009zk}. The viable particle physics models describing these results
contain some non-trivial, or even unnatural elements, however. First of all,
annihilation to quarks has to be very much suppressed, due to the
non-observation of an enhanced antiproton flux by PAMELA
\cite{Adriani:2010rc}. This means that only so-called {\em leptophilic} models,
where the annihilation only goes to leptons have to be considered. Here, one has
to have a sizeable fraction going to muons and tau leptons, as the shape of the
spectrum disfavours direct annihilation into electrons and positrons. To get
agreement with the measured absolute rates, one also has to have a large boost
factor (of the order of at least several hundred), which is difficult to achieve
with substructure alone. An additional enhancement of the annihilation rate has
to be invoked, for example given by the {\em Sommerfeld effect}. This basically
means that the usual connection between annihilation rate at decoupling (when
relative velocities $v/c$ were of order $0.2 - 0.3$), which gives the relic
density, and present-day annihilation in the halo (with velocities $v/c\sim
10^{-3}$) is broken. This would come about because the dark matter sector
contains additional light particles which mediates an interaction with almost
bound states which enhance the wave function at the relative origin, and
therefore the annihilation rate (for a pedagogical review of viable scenarios,
see \cite{ArkaniHamed:2008qn}). As a final difficulty of these models, the lack
of an inverse-Compton signature from the galactic center means that only shallow
density profiles can describe the galactic dark matter density distribution
\cite{Bertone:2008xr,Cirelli:2008pk,Bergstrom:2008ag}. (For a review of the dark
matter modelling of these effects, see \cite{Bergstrom:2009ib}. For a recent
treatment, showing still viable models, see \cite{Finkbeiner:2010sm}.)

A more standard explanation of the PAMELA/Fermi excess would be
pulsars or other supernova remnants (e.g.,
\cite{Hooper:2008kg,Ahlers:2009ae}). In that case, dark matter would
more likely be explained by the standard scenario of a WIMP, for
example the thoroughly studied lightest supersymmetric neutralino
(for reviews, see
\cite{Jungman:1995df,Bergstrom:2000pn,Bertone:2004pz}). We note that
the soon to be launched AMS-02 experiment on the International Space
Station \cite{ams02} may give interesting clues to the origin of the
antimatter excess.

\subsubsection{Leptophilic models}
\label{sect:LP}
The results of PAMELA \cite{Adriani:2008zr} and Fermi-LAT
\cite{Abdo:2009zk} (and to some extent ATIC
\cite{2008Natur.456..362C}, although the bump seen there at 600 GeV
has not been reproduced by other experiments) has caused intense
activity in the theoretical dark matter community. At first, there was
skepticism whether such a large signal could be compatible with a
WIMP. However, the possibility of an enhanced annihilation rate due to
dark matter halo substructure has been realized for a long time
\cite{1993ApJ...411..439S,Bergstrom:1998zs,Moore:1999nt}, although it
is difficult to achieve the boost factor of the order of a few
hundred to a thousand in the solar neighborhood, as substructure
according to numerical simulations is most important in the outer
portions of the halo, due to tidal stripping of subhaloes in the inner
part. Another potentially very important effect which may explain the
large boost had been found a few years earlier, namely the Sommerfeld
enhancement. This effect, was computed for electromagnetism by Arnold
Sommerfeld many years ago \cite{sommerfeld} and recently rediscovered
in the quantum field theory of dark matter
\cite{2005PhRvD..71f3528H,2007NuPhB.787..152C,2009PhRvD..79a5014A}.
In quantum mechanics describing electron scattering and electron
positron annihilation, it is caused by the distortion of the plane
wave describing the relative motion of the annihilating particle pair,
due to the near formation of a bound state caused by photon
exchange. In the ladder approximation for QED, one reproduces the
Sommerfeld effect, and the square of the relative wave function at the
origin (which enters into the probability for the short-distance
process of annihilation) is increased by the factor
\cite{2009PhRvD..79a5014A}
$$
S_{QED}=\frac{|\psi(0)|^2}{|\psi^{(0)}(0)|^2}=
\left|\frac{\frac{\pi\alpha}{v}}{1-e^{-\frac{\pi\alpha}{v}}}\right|,
$$ 
with $\alpha =e^2/\hbar c$ the fine-structure constant, and $v$ the relative
velocity. This amounts to $S_{QED}=\pi\alpha/v$ for small velocities. For a
Yukawa-like particle of mass $m_\phi$, mediating a weak attractive force with
coupling constant $\alpha_Y$ between dark matter particles $\chi$ with mass
$m_\chi$, the small-velocity limit of the enhancement becomes instead
$$
S_Y\sim\frac{\alpha_Y m_\chi}{m_\phi}.
$$ In the general case, with mediators that may also excite virtual
charged particles in the dark matter sector, one has to solve
numerically a coupled system of differential equations using
appropriate boundary conditions
\cite{2005PhRvD..71f3528H,2007NuPhB.787..152C,2009PhRvD..79a5014A}. In
some cases, the enhancement factor $S$ can be as high as several
hundred to a few thousand, depending however on the exact parameters of
the theory. The effect is usually strongly velocity-dependent,
depending on velocity as $1/v$ or, in the fine-tuning case of being
very near resonance, as $1/v^2$. This means that in a virialised
system (such as a galaxy cluster) with large velocity dispersion
$v_{\rm cl}$ the Sommerfeld enhancement will be smaller than the one
expected in a single galaxy such as the Milky Way, roughly by a factor
$v_{\rm MW}/v_{\rm cl}$.


As leptophilic models, apart from being slightly contrived from the
particle physics point of view, are also rather limited by several
sets of astrophysical data, we take advantage of the recent reanalysis
\cite{Finkbeiner:2010sm} to define a benchmark leptophilic model that
is still viable.  It is found that the bounds from WMAP5 approximately
imply a Sommerfeld boost factor $S$ which has to satisfy $S(v\to
0)\lesssim 200/f\ (m_Y/1$ GeV$)$, where $f$ is the fraction of energy
from dark matter annihilation that ionizes the intergalactic medium,
$f\sim 0.7$ for annihilation to electrons and a factor of a few smaller
for all other standard model final states.

Taking into account the whole cosmic history of leptophilic models,
also utilizing limit on spectral and polarization distorsions of the
CMB, the maximal value for the boost factor for a 1 to 2 TeV particle
and sub-GeV force carriers is found to be \cite{Finkbeiner:2010sm}
between 400 and 800. Although lower than the first estimates (e.g.,
\cite{Bergstrom:2009fa,Meade:2009iu}) this is still enough to explain
the PAMELA and Fermi excess, given other astrophysical uncertainties.

To connect easily to our previous work \cite{2009PhRvL.103r1302P}, we choose as
our benchmark leptophilic model one with mass $1.6$ TeV and Sommerfeld boost
$S=300$ for a Milky Way halo and scale this appropriately down for cluster halos, using

{\bf Anders: insert Sommerfeld boost formula as a function of halo mass}

Clusters have a larger velocity dispersion and an accordingly smaller Sommerfeld
boost factor. 


\subsubsection{Supersymmetric dark matter}
The most studied models for dark matter are supersymmetric ones, especially
models where the lightest supersymmetric particle, in most models the lightest
neutralino, is stable. The stability is assured in viable SUSY models due to a
discrete symmetry, $R$-parity. This symmetry is needed from the particle physics
point of view to avoid fast proton decay, and automatically makes the lightest
supersymmetric particle stable, and therefore a good candidate for dark
matter. In addition, as the coupling to ordinary matter is given by gauge
couplings, the neutralino is automatically a WIMP candidate. Unfortunately, the
breaking of supersymmetry (which has to be there since otherwise, e.g., there
would exist a scalar electron with the same mass as the electron) means that a
large number of essentially free parameters enter actual calculations.  The
neutralino is then a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the
U(1) gauge boson, $\tilde B$, one of the SU(2) gauge bosons, $\tilde W_3$, and
the two Higgs doublets in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard
Model (the MSSM), $\tilde H_1^0$ and $\tilde H_2^0$, with mixing coefficients
which depend on the SUSY breaking parameters \cite{1984NuPhB.238..453E}. The
parameter space is very large, too large in general to scan efficiently even
with the most powerful computers. Therefore, often simplifying assumptions are
made to limit the number of free parameters. Even then, a large number of viable
models is found which give a relic density consistent with the WMAP data. This
means that they are indeed very good templates for WIMP dark matter, something
that explains their popularity besides the subjective statement that few more
plausible models for dark matter have been put forward so far.

The the wave function of the lightest neutralino can be written
$$
\tilde\chi_1=a_1\tilde B+a_2\tilde W_3+a_3 \tilde H_1^0+a_4\tilde H_2^0,
$$
with 
$$
\sum_{i=1}^4 |a_i|^2=1.
$$
the gaugino fraction of a given neutralino is $|a_1|^2+|a_2|^2$ whereas $|a_3|^2+|a_4|^2$ is the higgsino fraction. 


We use the \ds package \cite{ds} to compute the mass, couplings and
relic density for a given set of parameters.  Actually, we take
advantage of so-called benchmark models, which have been proposed in
different contexts (in particular in \cite{Bringmann:2008kj} giving
predictions for the MAGIC experiment), and which give a good
representation of models with high enough gamma-ray rates to become
the first candidates for dark matter indirect detection in imaging air
Cherenkov telescopes. We use the following supersymmetric benchmark
models:

\begin{itemize}
\item
 $I′$: This model was introduced in \cite{2004EPJC...33..273B}, where
  its phenomenology at colliders was studied. Annihilation directly
  into lepton pairs is suppressed for neutralinos due to their
  Majorana nature and therefore helicity suppression for annihilation
  in the galactic halo \cite{1983PhRvL..50.1419G}. The higher order
  process (inner bremsstrahlung, IB) $\tilde\chi_1\tilde\chi_1\to
  \ell^+\ell^-\gamma$, which does not suffer from helicity suppression
  \cite{1989PhLB..225..372B,2008JHEP...01..049B}, gives a considerable
  contribution due to light sleptons in this model.

\item $J′$: This model, also from \cite{2004EPJC...33..273B} is in the
  so-called coannihilation tail. The sleptons are nearly degenerate
  with the neutralino, which causes the large IB from the leptonic
  final states to give a high enhancement of the flux.

\item $K′$: A representative model for the funnel region, where the
  annihilation dominantly occurs in the $s$-channel through exchange
  of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson \cite{2004EPJC...33..273B}. Here IB
  contributions are not important.

\item $J^*$: Annihilation in the so-called coannihilation region,
  introduced in \cite{2008JHEP...01..049B} as BM3, with a particularly
  large IB contribution.

\end{itemize}

{\bf Anders: add DM particle mass and cross section to all these 4 models}


\subsubsection{Final state radiation}
There are two types of radiative processes which are important for our
benchmark models, first the usual QED final state radiation (FSR) for
both the leptophilic model and for supersymmetric models with charged
final states. In addition, there may be direct emission from a
virtual, charged, exchanged particle (such as a spin-0 slepton or
squark), internal bremsstrahlung, IB. The latter is essentially only
important when there is a helicity suppression for the lowest order
annihilation process, which is the case for neutralinos, whose
Majorana nature make the annihilation rate in the $s$ wave
proportional to $m_f^2$, for final state fermion $f$. Interestingly,
both the gamma-ray and fermion energy spectra are peaked at the
highest energy for this process, which can in some models cause a
rather spectacular bump in the spectra for these models.

The photon spectrum resulting from FSR is universal with only a
weak dependence of the underlying particle physics model. The photon
yield from this process is given by (see
e.g. \cite{2008JHEP...01..049B})
\begin{equation}
\frac{\dd N_{X \bar{X}}}{\dd x} \approx \frac{\alpha Q_X^2}{\pi}
\mathcal{F}_X(x) \log\left[\frac{4 m_\chi^2\left(1-x\right)}{m_X^2}\right]\,.
\end{equation}
Here, the normalized photon energy $x=\eg/m_\chi c^2$, 
$\alpha =e^2/\hbar c$ is the fine-structure constant, 
$Q_X^2$ and $m_X$ the
charge and mass of the final state particle $X$, respectively. The function
$\mathcal{F}_X(x)$ depends on the spin of the final state and is given
by
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_\rmn{fermion}(x) = \frac{1+\left(1-x\right)^2}{x}\,
\end{equation}
for fermions. 

The differential energy spectrum for the IB process is more
complicated (see \cite{1989PhLB..225..372B,2008JHEP...01..049B}), but
can be computed using {\sc DarkSUSY}. The differential photon energy
spectra for all our benchmark models are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:q_DM}.
The peaking at high photon energy and the resulting bump caused by
inner bremsstrahlung is clearly seen for benchmark models $I´$, $J´$,
and $J^*$. Despite the different particle masses and cross sections,
the spectrum of the continuums emission shows a remarkably similar
shape which suggests that a simple rescaling of particle masses
(responsible for the exponential cutoff in the spectrum) and cross
sections (spectral amplitude) should yield a roughly scale-invariant
contiuums emission spectrum except for the presence of the final state
emission feature which depends on the details of the specific decay
channels. The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:q_DM} shows the cumuative
number of leptons (electrons and positrons) above a given energy for
our different DM models which is of interested for the high-energy
inverse Compton emission of those leptons.  Only leptophilic (LP)
models have energetic enough electrons such that the IC emission is
powerful enough to either be constrained or detected at GeV energies
and higher.

\subsection{Astrophysical modeling of DM induced emission}
\label{sect:AP}

We now turn to the detailed modeling of the surface brightness
profiles of DM annihilation emission and discuss the DM profiles for
the smooth distribution and substructures.

\subsubsection{General equations}

The differential photon flux within a given solid angle $\Delta
\Omega$ along a line-of-sight (los) is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dflux}
\frac{\dd \fg}{\dd \eg} \equiv \frac{\dd^3 \ngamma}{\dd A \,\dd t\, \dd
  \egamma} = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Delta\Omega} \dd\psi \sin\psi \frac{\dd \sg}{\dd \eg}(\psi,\eg)\,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dtildeflux}
\frac{\dd \sg}{\dd \eg}(\psi,>\eg) = \int_{\Delta\Omega} \dd\Omega \int_{\rm los}
\dd l\, q_{\rm sum}\left(\eg,r\right)\Lambda(\theta)\,,
\end{equation}
and $\sg(\psi, >\eg)$ denotes the surface brightness above the photon
energy $\eg$.  The integration along the line-of-sight $l$, in the
direction $\psi$ that the detector is pointing, is parameterized such
that the radius of the source $r=\sqrt{l^2+D_\clu^2-2 D_\clu
  l\cos\Psi}$, where $D_\clu$ is the distance to the source from the
galactic center and
$\cos\Psi\equiv\cos\theta\cos\psi-\cos\varphi\sin\theta\sin\psi$ {\bf
  Anders: I do not understand this equation: why galactic
  center?}. The angular integration $\dd \Omega= \sin\theta\dd \theta
\,\dd \varphi$ is performed over a cone centered around $\psi$ and the
opening angle $\Delta \Omega$ is typically taken to be a few times the
point spread function (PSF) $\psf$. The limited angular resolution
results in a probability that a photon coming from a direction $\psi$'
is instead reconstructed to a direction $\psi$, where the underlying
probability distribution follow a Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
\Lambda(\theta)=\frac{1}{2\pi\psf^2}
\,\rmn{exp}\left[-\frac{\theta^2}{2\psf^2}\right]\,,
\quad \rmn{where}\quad \theta=\psi'-\psi \,.
\end{equation}
We denote the total differential source function by $q_{\rm
  sum}(\eg,r)$, where we include contributions from five main
processes; leptophilic DM annihilating either indirectly through
$\mu^+/\mu^-$ to $\rmn{e}^+/\rmn{e}^-$ or directly to
$\rmn{e}^+/\rmn{e}^-$ pairs that inverse Compton upscatter background
photons (LP-IC), leptophilic DM emitting final state radiation
(LP-FSR), supersymmetric DM benchmark models where annihilating
neutralinos generate $\rmn{e}^+/\rmn{e}^-$ pairs that upscatter
background photons (BM-IC) and emit a continuum as well as final state
radiation (BM-Cont), and CR proton induced $\pi^0$ that decays into
gamma-rays (CR-$\pi^0$). The source function is given by
\begin{equation}
q_\rmn{sum} (\eg,r) = \qCR(\eg,r)+
\sum_i \,q_{\rmn{sm},i}(\eg,r)\,\B_{\rmn{tot},i}(\sigv,r)
\end{equation}
the differential CR to gamma-ray source function is denoted by
$\qCR(\eg,r)$ (see Sect.~\ref{sect:CRs} and \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}
for further details). The subscript $i$ runs over the gamma-ray
producing DM channels and the total differential boost factor for DM
is given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\B_{\rmn{tot},i}(r,\sigv) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
\B_\sfe(\sigv)\,\B_{\sub,i}(r) &\rmn{for\,\,LP}\\
\B_{\sub,i}(r) &\rmn{for\,\,BM\,.}\end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray}
It is the product of enhancement factors from SFE $\B_\sfe(\sigv)$
(see Sect.~\ref{sect:LP}) and from substructure enhancement over the
smooth halo contribution $\B_{\sub,i}(r) =
1+\rho_{\sub,i}^2(r)/\rho^2(r)$ (see Sect.~\ref{sect:subst}). {\bf
  Anders: please add equation for $\B_{\sub,i}(M_{halo})$ here and
  reference $B_{sfe}$ equation.} The DM source function from the
smooth halo for each process is written in the form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:q_sm}
q_{\rmn{sm},i} (\egamma,r) = \sum_j
\frac{\dd \ngammaj}{\dd E_\gamma} \Gamma_j(r)\,,
\end{equation}
where the annihilation rate density is given by 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ann_rate}
\Gamma_j(r) = \frac{1}{2} \left[\frac{\rho(r)}{\mx}\right]^2 
\, \sigmaannv_j\,.
\end{equation}
Here runs the subscript $j$ over all kinematically allowed gamma-ray
producing channels, each with the spectrum $\frac{\dd
  \ngammaj}{\dd\eg}$ and annihilation cross-section $\sigmaannv_j$.
We denote the DM mass with $\mx$ and the smooth DM density profile
with $\rho(r)$.


\subsubsection{The smooth DM density profile}
\label{sect:smooth}

 Typically the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density
profile provides a good fit to both the observed and simulated
clusters. It can be considered as a special case of the more general
5-parameter profile:
\begin{equation}
\rho(r) = \frac{\rhos}{\left(r/r_\s\right)^\beta
  \left[1+\left(r/r_\s\right)^\alpha\right]^\delta}\,,\quad
\delta=\frac{\gamma - \beta}{\alpha}\,.
\label{eq:rho_nfw}
\end{equation}
Here, $\beta$ denotes the inner slope, $\gamma$ is the outer slope,
and $\alpha$ is the shape parameter that determines the profile shape
at the scaling radius $r_\s$ that characterizes the transition between
the different power-law slopes. A cuspy NFW profile is given by
$(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)=(1,1,3)$. The characteristic overdensity for an
NFW profile is given by
\begin{equation}
\rhos(c)=\frac{\Delta\,\rhoc}{3}\,\frac{c^3}
{\log\left(1+c\right)-c/(1+c)}\,,
\label{eq:rho_s}
\end{equation}
 where the halo mass dependent concentration parameter $c$ is derived
 from a power-law fit to cosmological simulations with $\mvir \gtrsim
 10^{10} \msun$ \cite{2008MNRAS.391.1940M},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cfit}
  c=3.56 \times \left(\frac{\mvir}{10^{15}\,\msun}\right)^{-0.098}\,.
\end{equation}
This mass scaling agrees well with \cite{2009ApJ...707..354Z} for
cluster-mass halos after converting the concentration definitions
according to \cite{2003ApJ...584..702H}. In this work we choose to
model the DM density by an Einasto density profile
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dens_ein}
\rho_{\rm ein}(r) = \rho_{-2}\,\exp\left\{-\frac{2}{\alpha}
  \left[\left(\frac{r}{r_{-2}}\right)^\alpha -1 \right] \right\},\,
\alpha=0.17 \,,
\end{equation}
that is slightly shallower in the center than the conventional
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, but provide a better fit to recent
simulated high resolution DM halos \cite{2010MNRAS.402...21N}. It
should also be noted that a recent observations of the Abell 383
galaxy cluster finds a core like density profile with an inner slope
of $\beta=0.6$, where $\beta\gtrsim 1$ can be ruled out to a $>95$\%
confidence \cite{2011ApJ...728L..39N}. These observations are based on
lensing and X-ray measurements as well as the stellar velocity
dispersion of the central galaxy. In Eq.~(\ref{eq:dens_ein}) we denote
the density where the profile has a slope of $-2$ by $\rho_{-2}$, and
the radius by $r_{-2}$.  Assuming that all the flux from an NFW profile
originate from within the scale radius $\rs=\rvir/c$, and all the flux
from an Einasto profile originate within $r_{-2}=\rvir/c$, it follows
that $\rho_{-2} = \rhos/4$. {\bf Anders: MIGHT REMOVE THIS, COULD NOT REPRODUCE IT, CAN
MOTIVATE THE FACTOR 4 FROM MATCHING THE MASSES FROM THE EINSASTO WITH
THE NFW INSTEAD] SHOW INTEGRATION, COMPUTE RMAX}

%However, this finding is hard to reconcile with simulations that
%typically prefere a steeper central profile.

\subsubsection{Substructures}
\label{sect:subst}
High-resolution DM only simulations of Milky Way (MW) type halos find
substantial amount of substructures in the periphery of DM halos,
while the substructures in the center suffer from dynamical friction
and tidal effects depleating their central number densities. Since the
DM annihilation rate depends on the density squared, the resulting
flux from substructures is boosted compared to the smooth density
distribution. Recent high resolution simulations suggest a flux
enhancement from substructures of the order of ten up to a few 100
\cite{2008MNRAS.391.1685S, 2008JPhCS.125a2008K} for a MW size
halo. {\bf Anders: motivate why we take 200; is there a reference that
  shows that Kuhlen now also get 100-200?}  We use a double power-law
function to fit \footnote{Our approach of fitting the scaling behavior
  of $\rmn{L_{sub}}(<r)$ directly from numerical simulations
  self-consistently accounts for the radial dependence of the
  substructure concentration \cite{2008MNRAS.391.1685S}.} the
luminosity from the smooth component of substructures
(i.e. substructures within substructures are not included) inside
radius $r$ which is determined for the Aquarius simulations
\cite{2008MNRAS.391.1685S,2008Natur.456...73S}. Our best fit is given
by
\begin{eqnarray}
  {\rm L_{sub}}(<x) &=& a_0\,C(\mvir)\,{\rm L_{200sm}}(\mvir)\,x^{a_1
    \displaystyle{x}^{a_2}}\,,\label{eq:LSub}\\
   a_0 &=& 0.76\,,\quad a_1 = 0.95\,,\quad  a_2 = -0.27\,, \quad 
 \nonumber\\
  C(\mvir) &=& \left(\frac{\mvir\,M_{\rm res,sim}}
{M_{\rm 200sim}\,M_{\rm lim}}\right)^{\alpha_C}
=0.023\,\left(\frac{\mvir}{M_{\rm lim}}\right)^{\alpha_C}.\nonumber\\
\label{eq:Csub}
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $\alpha_C=0.226$, $a_i$ denote our fit variables, ${\rm
  L_{200sm}}$ is the luminosity from the smooth halo without
substructures within $\rvir$ and $x= r/\rvir$.  We derive the
normalization function $C(\mvir)$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Csub}) from the
simulations in reference \cite{2008Natur.456...73S} using a value of
$M_{\rm 200sim}=1.9\times10^{12}\msun$ for the mass of the MW halo in
the simulation and $M_{\rm res,sim}=10^5\msun$ for the mass of the
smallest resolved subhalos in the MW simulation.  The smallest mass of
subhalos in reality, $M_{\rm lim}$, is determined from the free
streaming length of DM at decoupling---an effect that erases structure
on scales smaller than the free streaming length. In applying
Eq.~(\ref{eq:Csub}), we implicitely assume that the mass power-law
scaling relation is valid down to the free streaming mass of DM
halos. In the cold dark matter universe, this is conventionally taken
to be $10^{-6}\msun$ \cite{2001PhRvD..64h3507H,
  2005JCAP...08..003G}. Note that potentially the power-law could
flatten towards smaller mass scales although current simulations show
no hits of such a behavior and since Einstein's gravity is a
scale-free theory, we do not expect such a behavior on theoretical
grounds either.  For DM halos more (less) massive than the MW we
expect a larger (smaller) boost from substructures, simply because of
the larger (smaller) mass range down to the minimum mass
$M_\rmn{lim}$.

We now derive the squared density profile for the substructures
using
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho_\rmn{sub}^2(r) &=& \frac{\dd \rmn{L_{sub}}}{\dd V} \frac{1}{A_{\rmn{dm}}},\\
\rmn{L_{200sm}} &=&  A_{\rmn{dm}} \int_{\rvir} \dd r' 4\pi r'^2 \rho^2(r'),\label{eq:Lsm}\\
 \frac{\dd \rmn{L_{sub}}}{\dd V} &=& a_0\,a_1\,C(\mvir)\,x^{a_2+a_1\,x^{a_2}}\,
\left[\frac{1+a_2\log(x)}{4\pi\,r^3}\right],\\
x &=& r/\rvir\,.
\end{eqnarray} 

The different density profiles have some impact on the luminosity from
annihilating DM, although the details of the density profile can be
neglected compared to the dominating boost from substructures
(assuming dark matter to be cold). In Fig.~\ref{fig:radial_lum} we
compare the radial dependence of the accumulative luminosity from
different smooth cluster density profiles to the boosted luminosity
due to substructure for different mass scales. We recalculate the
density contrast for the core like NFW density profile $\rhos$ and
rescale the concentration parameter in Eq.~(\ref{eq:cfit}) with
$300/160$ \cite{2011ApJ...728L..39N} to account for the more
centralized scale radius in cluster with a softer cusp. The emission
coming from the density profile with a shallower inner slope
($\beta=0.6$) as obtained by recent lensing and velocity dispersion
measurements of the central galaxy \cite{2011ApJ...728L..39N} compared
to a cuspy NFW ($\beta=1.0$) is about 30\% larger within $\rvir$. This
difference is build up within $0.1\rvir$ (i.e. close to $r_\s$). Hence
the slope of the central part of a cluster has little influence for
the DM luminosity within $\rvir$ as long as the degeneracy in the
lensing mass measurements with $r_\s$ (which decreases for decreasing
inner slope) has been taken into account. The emission from an Einasto
density profile is about 50\% larger than the cuspy NFW profile in the
periphery of the cluster, where the difference is mainly build up at a
few percent of $\rvir$. The increase in luminosity due to substructure
is neglible in the center of halos, but integrated out to $\rvir$ the
boost relative to the smooth emission profile amounts to approximately
10 for dwarf galaxies, $10^2$ for galaxies, and $10^3$ for galaxy
clusters.
\begin{figure}%[t]
 \includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{figures/dens.prof.eps}

   accumulative smooth luminosity from a cluster with the mass

   Einasto profile with $\alpha=0.17$ (light blue), a cuspy NFW
   profile with $\beta=1.0$ (dark blue), and a core NFW profile with

   luminosity from substructures for three different mass scales; an

   $\mvir=10^{8}\,\msun$ dwarf galaxy (green). All luminosities have
   been normalized with the luminosity within $\rvir$ from a cuspy NFW
   profile. We have assumed the standard value for the limiting
   substructure mass of $M_\rmn{lim}=10^{-6}\,\msun$. Note the large
   expected boost from substructures in clusters ($\sim1000$), and the
   relative small boost in dwarf galaxies ($\sim20$).}
 \label{fig:radial_lum}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:radial_emis} we show the radial regions that dominate
the DM annihilation luminosity, in particular we show the differential
contribution to the DM luminosity per logarithmic interval in radius
for three different mass scales. Solving for the maximum of this
curve, $\dd^2L_{200sm}/\dd (\log x)^2=0$ in combination with
Eqn.~\ref{eq:Lsm}, we find that the luminosity from the smooth NFW
profile peaks at $r \simeq \rvir/3c$. Despite the cuspy nature of the
density profile, the luminosity is not dominated by the central region
but by the transition region where the profile steepens because of the
larger volume available there. For large clusters with typical
concentrations of $c = r_{200}/r_\s \simeq 4$, the luminosity from the
smooth profile is focused to the regime around 10\% of $\rvir$. In
contrast, emission from substructures is mainly contributed by the
outer parts of DM halos where the number density of subhalos steepens
considerably.  Note that, even though most of the substructures have
been erased in the central regions of DM halos, a cluster in
projection has a significant enhancement due to substructures at a
radius of just a few percent of $\rvir$.

    of the flux is delivered by a region around $r_\s/3$ as indicated
    by the maximum value of the curves. In contrast, for substructures
    the emission is dominated by regions around $r_{200}$.}

\subsection{Inverse Compton emission}
\label{sect:IC}

In this section we outline the basics of inverse Compton (IC)
emission. As target radiation fields we consider  cosmic microwave
background (CMB) photons, and the light from stars and dust (SD). We
derive a semi-analytic model from which we can estimate the spectral
and spatial distributions of SD as a simple function of cluster mass.

The standard IC source function is given by
\cite{1979rpa..book.....R}:
\begin{eqnarray}
  q_{\rmn IC}(\eg, r) &=&  \frac{\dd^3 N_\gamma}{\dd V\,\dd t\,\dd \eg} = 
 \frac{3}{4}c\,\sigma_\rmn{T}
\int\dd \eph \frac{n_\rmn{ph}(\eph)}{\eph}\nonumber\\
&\times& \int \dd \ee\,\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd \ee}(\ee,r)\,
 \frac{\left(m_\e c^2\right)^2}{\ee^2}G(\Gamma_\e,q)\,,\nonumber\\
  \label{eq:ICemiss}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\ee$ is the energy of the upscattering electrons and $\eph$ is
the energy of the background photon field. We represent the Thomson
cross-section with $\sigma_\rmn{T}$ and the full differential
Klein-Nishina (KN) cross-section is captured by
\cite{1970RvMP...42..237B}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:KN_spec}
G(\Gamma_\e,q) = 2q\ln{q}+(1+2q)(1-q)+ 
\frac{1}{2}\frac{\left(\Gamma_\e q\right)^2\left(1-q\right)}
     {1+\Gamma_\e q}\,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_\e=\frac{4\eph \ee}{\left(m_\e c^2\right)^2}\,,\qquad \rmn{and} \qquad  
q=\frac{\eg}{\Gamma_\e\left(\ee-\eg\right)}\,.
\end{equation}
The full KN cross-section accounts for the less efficient energy
transfer between the photon and electron once the energy of the
Lorentz-boosted photon in the electron rest frame comes close to $m_\e
c^2$ such that the scattering electrons experiences a significant
recoil. This results in a steepening of the IC gamma-ray spectrum. In
the low energy Thomson regime the IC spectrum $F_\gamma\sim
E_\gamma^{-(\alpha_\e-1)/2}$, however when $\Gamma_\e \gg 1$ the IC
spectrum steepens due to the KN suppression to
$\eg^{-\alpha_\e}\log(\eg)$. Here we denote the steady state electron
spectrum by $\alpha_\e$.

We account for two major contributions to the number density of
radiative background fields $n_\ph$; the CMB photons and the infra-red
(IR) to ultra-violet (UV) light emitted by SD. The number density for
the SD is given by $n_\ph\equiv\frac{\dd^2 N_\ph}{\dd V \,\dd
  \eph}(\eph,r)= \frac{u_\sd(\eph,r)}{\eph^2}$ where the SD energy
density $u_\sd(\eph,r)$ is given in the Appendix, Eq.~(\ref{eq:U_SD}). We model the
CMB photon spectrum as a photon gas that is isotropically distributed
and follows a black body spectrum with the temperature $T=2.73\,$~K:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:photon_gas}
  n_\rmn{ph}(\eph) = \frac{\dd^2 N_\ph}{\dd V \,\dd \eph} =
  \frac{1}{\pi^2(\hbar c)^3}\frac{\eph^2}{\exp(\eph/k_\B T)-1}\,.
\end{equation}
Note that the typical energy of a black body photon before scattering
is given by $\langle\eph\rangle=\epsilon_\ph/\tilde{n}_\ph\approx\,2.7\, k_\B T$,
where $\tilde{n}_\ph$ and $\epsilon_\ph$ are the number- and
energy-density derived by integrating $n_\ph(\eph)$ and $\eph
n_\ph(\eph)$ over the photon energy $\eph$, respectively.

The electrons injected from annihilating DM also suffer from diffusive
and radiative losses. Hence we have to calculate the equilibrium
spectrum of the electrons plus positrons denoted by $\frac{\dd
  n_\e}{\dd \ee}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ICemiss}). We derive this stationary
solution using the CR transport equation (neglecting convection and
re-acceleration effects):
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:CRdiffusion}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd \ee}\right) = 
&\nabla& \left[D\left(\ee,\bx\right)\nabla\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd \ee}\right] + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \ee}
\left[b\left(\ee,\bx\right) \frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd \ee}\right]
 \nonumber \\
&+& q_\e(\ee,\bx)\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $D(\ee,\bx)$ denotes the diffusion coefficient and $b(\ee,\bx)$
the energy loss term. The source function $q_\e(\ee,\bx)$ yields the
number of electrons and positrons produced per unit time, energy and
volume element at the position $\bx$:
\begin{equation}
q_\e(\ee,r)=\sum_f\frac{\dd N_{\e,f}}{\dd \ee}(\ee) B_f \Gamma_f(r) \,,
\end{equation}
where the annihilation rate density $\Gamma_f(r)$ is defined in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:ann_rate}). The sum runs over the kinematically allowed
annihilation final states $f$, each with a branching ratio $B_f$ and a
differential spectrum $\frac{\dd N_\e^f}{\dd \ee}$ that represents the
number of electrons plus positrons resulting from an annihilation
event. For neutralinos annihilating directly into electrons and
positrons we model the spectral distribution with $\frac{\dd
  N_\e^f}{\dd \ee}= 2\delta(\ee-m_\chi c^2)$. We use DarkSUSY to
compute both the spectra when neutralinos annihilate directly into a
$\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ in the leptophilic model as well as in the four BM
models where a fraction of the annihilating neutralinos is converted
into electrons and positrons (see Sect.~\ref{sect:PF} and
Fig.~\ref{fig:q_DM} for further details).
%(see \cite{2009JCAP...01..016B} and references therein,
%also see fit).  

The electrons and positrons loose their energy on a timescale that is
shorter than the diffusive timescale in the ICM of galaxy clusters for
CR electrons with $\ee \gtrsim\,$~MeV {\bf Anders: CHECK}. Hence, we neglect the
first term of the r.h.s. in Eq.~(\ref{eq:CRdiffusion}), and derive an
expression for the equilibrium number density:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd \ee}}\left(\ee, r \right) &=&
 \frac{1}{b(\ee, r)} \int_{\ee}^{\mx c^2} \dd \ee' \, 
  Q(\ee', r),
\label{eq:nds}\\
b(\ee,r) &=& \tilde{b}
\left[\frac{B^2_{\rm CMB}}{8\pi}+\frac{B^2(r)}{8\pi}+u_\sd(r)\right] \ee^2\,,
\\\tilde{b}&=&\frac{4\sigma_{\rm T}c}{3(m_{\rm e}c^2)^2}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Here we include the three main radiative loss processes for the CR
electrons and positrons: (1) IC losses on CMB photons where the
equivalent field strength of the CMB is denoted by $B_{\rm
  CMB}=3.24\mu\rmn{G}\,(1+z)^2$, where $z$ is the cosmological
redshift. (2) Synchrotron losses on ambient magnetic fields where we
parameterize the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster by $B(r) =
3\mu\rmn{G} \,[n_{\rm e}(r)/n_{\rm e}(0)]^{\alpha_\B}$. We adopt a
magnetic decline of $\alpha_\B=0.7$ in this work which follows from
flux frozen magnetic fields. (3) IC losses on starlight and dust with
an energy density $u_\sd(r)$ given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:U_SD}), which we
derive in the following.

The emission of galaxy clusters at infra-red (IR) and ultra-violet
(UV) wavelengths emerges from dust and starlight in both the galaxies
and the ICM (e.g. \cite{2006ApJ...648L..29P} and
\cite{2009MNRAS.399.1694G}). Three distinctive components dominate
these wavelengths: a central galaxy, the intra-cluster light, and
individual cluster galaxies. We decided to use the accurately measured
spectral shape of dust and starlight in the interstellar medium of our
Galaxy to model the emmission from clusters. We then normalize the two
spectral components -- far IR dust and starlight at wavelengths ranging
from the near IR to UV -- individually by using stacked cluster data and employ a
measured mass-to-starlight luminosity scaling relation derived from
observations of the brightest cluster galaxy
\cite{2010ApJ...713.1037H}.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:SD_spectra} we characterize the spectral shape
through a fit to the galactic spectra presented in
\cite{2006ApJ...648L..29P}.  The figure is showing the spectra at
$r=0.03\rvir$, which is the radius there the SD energy density of a
galaxy cluster equals the energy density of the CMB black-body
distribution. Inside this central radius the SD component is
dominating, which is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SD_Edens} where we compare
the energy densities from different radiation fields in a galaxy
cluster with the mass $\mvir=10^{15}\msun$. For this figure we use two
different profiles for the SD energy density, where the total profile
includes the contribution from the ICL, the BCG and all the galaxies,
while the galaxies are excluded in the smooth profile. {\bf Anders:
  add the order of magnitude calculation that the overlap of galaxies
  with smooth profile or substructures is minor, 1e-4 if I remember
  correctly, motivating that we go along with the smooth SD profile.}
We find that even for a cluster with a relative small mass the energy
density of the SD components dominates over the CMB and the magnetic
fields (with a central B field of 3~$\mu G$) within about 10\% of
$\rvir$. Outside this radius the CMB is dominating the energy density
of the cluster.  Note that while the magnetic field is always
subdominant in the cluster for our assumptions, we keep its
contribution to the total energy density for consistency. Also note
that we extract the spatial distribution of the SD light in clusters
from a stacked emission analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
data at the redshift $\sim 0.25$ \cite{2005MNRAS.358..949Z} and do not
attempt to correct for a potential evolution in this component
(c.f. Fig.~\ref{fig:SD_spatial}).

\subsection{Cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission}
\label{sect:CRs}

In supernovae remnants and on scales of galaxies, there are convincing
evidences of non-thermal populations. Especially, in the MW, the
cosmic rays are observed directly as well as indirectly through radio,
X-ray, and gamma-ray emission. On larger scales of the order of few
100~kpc up to Mpc, there are currently a vast number of observations
of radio emission coming from radio mini halos in the center of
cooling flow clusters, radio relics in the periphery of clusters
\cite{2004rcfg.proc..335K} as well as smooth giant radio halos that
have been observed in more than 50 clusters
\cite{2003ASPC..301..143F,2008SSRv..134...93F}. This type of emission
is expected in clusters since the formation process of a galaxy
cluster is a very energetic processes that induces both turbulence as
well as frequently occurring merging and accretion shocks which both
are thought to accelerate relativistic non-thermal protons and radio
emitting electrons to high energies. Thus most of the observed radio
emission in clusters is expected to emerge from cosmic-ray electron
induced radio synchrotron emission. The precise origin of these
electrons, in especially relics and giant radio halos, is still not
settled. One possible scenario for the production of these electrons
are hadronic CR interactions with ambient gas protons which results in
the production of both charged and neutral pions that decay into
electrons, neutrinos, and gamma-rays. \footnote{An alternative
  scenario is the second order turbulent re-acceleration through the
  interaction of a previously injected relativistic population of
  electrons by supernova driven winds or active galactic nuclei with
  plasma waves and magneto-turbulence.} {\bf Anders: please add
  references for the hadronic/re-acceleration scenario; look them up
  from our Ensslin-transport paper.} Supporting evidence comes from
the smoothness of the extended radio emission that often resembles
that observed in thermal X-rays. Especially since the long cooling
time of cosmic ray protons (CRps) allows for an extended and large
population of CRps to build up over the cluster history
\cite{1997ApJ...487..529B}.  The production of these secondaries
depend both on the gas and CRp densities in the cluster, where the CRp
density roughly traces the gas outside the core regime and is slightly
enhanced in the center.  This density scaling implies that clusters
are great targets for Cherenkov telescopes with a high sensitivity for
the central parts of nearby clusters. Detecting the cluster gamma-ray
emission is crucial in this respect as it potentially provides the
unique and unambiguous evidence of CRp populations in clusters through
observing the $\pi^0$ bump at about 100~MeV in the spectra.

We adopt the universal spectral and spatial gamma-ray model developed
by Pinzke \& Pfrommer \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} to estimate the
emission from decaying $\pi^0$:s that dominates over the inverse
Compton emission from primary and secondary electrons above 100~MeV in
clusters. The gamma-ray formalism was derived from high resolution
simulations of clusters of galaxies that included radiative
hydrodynamics, star formation, supernova feedback, and followed CRp
physics using a novel formulation that trace the most important
injection and loss processes self-consistently while accounting for
the CRp pressure in the equation of motion
\cite{2008A&A...481...33J,2007A&A...473...41E,2006MNRAS.367..113P}.
We note that the overall normalization of the CRp and gamma-ray
distribution scales with the maximum acceleration efficiency at
structure formation shock waves. Following recent observations at
supernova remnants \cite{2009Sci...325..719H} as well as theoretical
studies \cite{2005ApJ...620...44K}, we adopt a realistic value of this
parameter and assume that 50\% of the dissipated energy at strong
shocks is injected into CRps while this efficiency rapidly decreases
for weaker shocks \cite{2007A&A...473...41E}. As a caviat we note that
the semi-analytic odel is based on simulations that only considered
advective transport of CRs by turbulent gas motions which produces
centrally enhanced profiles. However active CR transport such as CR
diffusion and streaming tends to drive the CR radial profiles towards
being flat, with equal CR number density everywhere. While the CR
streaming is then usually larger than typical advection velocities and
becomes comparable or lower than this only for periods with trans- and
supersonic cluster turbulence during a cluster merger. As a
consequence a bimodality of the CR spatial distribution results with
merging (relaxed) clusters showing a centrally concentrated (flat) CR
energy density profile \cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}.  This translates
into a bimodality of the expected diffuse radio and gamma-ray emission
of clusters, since more centrally concentrated CR will find higher
target densities for hadronic CR proton interactions
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}. As a result of this, relaxed clusters
could have a reduced gamma-ray luminosity by up to a factor of five.
 



\section{Gamma-ray spectra}
\label{sect:spectral}
Spectrally resolved indirect DM searches have the advantage of probing
different DM models through their characteristic spectral
distributions. To make current and future DM searches more effective
it is important to know in which energy band to focus the efforts in
order to maximize potential DM signals over the expected background.

We focus in this section on the spectral distribution of gamma-rays
from clusters.  In the leptophilic model, DM annihilation radiation
includes final state radiation and give rise to substantial amounts of
electrons and positrons that IC upscatter background radiation fields
to high energies. We also consider a few supersymmetric DM models with
a high gamma-ray yield in the form of continuum emission and IC
induced emission. In addition to the annihilating DM, we estimate the
gamma-ray flux induced by shock accelerated CRps.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:diff_BM} we show the differential flux from the
Fornax cluster which is one of the best clusters for indirect DM
searches due to its relative high DM induced fluxes and low CR induced
fluxes. We derive the emission from four different supersymmetric BM
models and the emission induced by CRps. Comparing this emission to
the differential gamma-ray upper limits set by Fermi-LAT after 18
months of observations \cite{2010ApJ...717L..71A}, we find that the
upper limits are not violated. The predicted DM flux that is dominated
by the continuum emission from $\Kp$ and $\Ip$ models (shown in the
left panels) are close to the upper limits and can potentially be
probed by the Fermi 3 year data. Furthermore, the gamma-ray signal
induced by CRps is expected to be about a factor 10 below the DM
continuum flux from the $\Kp$ and $\Ip$ BM models around
10~GeV. However, the IC emission from upscattered CMB and SD photons
is at least a factor 10 lower than the expected flux from CRps above
100~MeV, making it very hard to distinguish such a signal from the
foreground due to the similar spectral index. For energies below
100~MeV we expect inverse Compton emission by primary shock
accelerated electrons to be dominating \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} over
the supersymmetric DM induced leptons. Hence the IC emission from
supersymmetric DM in clusters can for DM benchmark models be safely
neglected compared to the CRps and DM continuum emission.

\del{CONSIDER REWRITING, START WITH PHYSICS, THEN DISCUSS DOMINATING
CONTRIBUTIONS, PEAKS, AND SPECTRAL INDICES}

One of the main contributions to the expected extended gamma-ray is
coming from the IC upscattered photons on various photon background
fields. Depending on the spatial and spectral distribution of
electrons and positrons as well as the photon background field, the
resulting spectral distributions of gamma-ray can differ
greatly. Hence it is interesting to understand which spectral features
and energy regimes that are dominating for the different DM models.

If the substructure boost in clusters is significant, then the total
electron and positron distribution is dominated by its radial profile
outside the very center where the smooth density profile dominates
over the substructures and the cooling from SD dominates over the
CMB. Especially since the SD distribution is centrally peaked and the
substructure distribution peaks in the outskirts around $\rvir$, the
overlap is small. This results in a suppression of the IC upscattered
SD photons relative to the IC upscattered CMB, the FSR and the
continuum emission. However if substructures are only marginally
dominating over the smooth distribution in a cluster, the SD component
becomes more important, especially in the 100~GeV to 1~TeV energy
regime where the IC on CMB photons is small. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:IR_comp} we show the total IC emission as well as its
individual contributions from different IC upscattered radiation
fields. The left panel show the gamma-ray emission from the LP model
and the right panel from the $\Kp$ BM model, and for comparison we
overplot the emission expected from the CRps. Due to the flat electron
and positron spectrum resulting from the LP DM model and the smaller
mean energy of the CMB compared to the SD, we find that the
upscattered CMB photons dominate the total DM IC emission in the
energy regime below 100~GeV, while the SD dominate above this
energy. For the BM models this transition is shifted towards a smaller
energy since the electron and positron spectrum has a steep spectral
distribution that suppresses low energy photon fields. \del{This
  suppression is also seen in the relative normalization of the flux
  where the IC from both CMB and dust photons are lower compared to
  the starlight simply because the starlight has a higher energy,
  hence it is upscattered by more abundant low energy electrons and
  positrons (c.f. Fig.~\ref{fig:q_DM}).} At the highest gamma-ray
energies of about 100~GeV and above, the IC from starlight steepens
because it both probes the high energy tail of the electrons as well
as suffer from the KN suppression. It should be noted that if we
remove the boost from substructures, the density profile of electrons
and prositrons is more centrally peaked, and the relative importance
of the IC upscattered SD increases. In addition the IC upscattered CMB
light would suffer more from SD cooling in the center. \del{Even though
the SD component seems to be suppressed compared to the CMB at
energies around 100~MeV, it has a relative large impact on the steady
state electron spectrum. If we remove the SD cooling, we find a factor
two larger IC flux at low energies for a cluster of the size of
Fornax. For more massive clusters we expect a larger IC flux from the
SD component, but a smaller contribution from the CMB because of the
more effective cooling.} EXPAND DISCUSSION

Because of the large boost factor for the LP model ($\sim 10^4$), we
overproduce the upper gamma-ray limit in the $1-10$~GeV energy
interval set by Fermi-LAT by about a factor 100. This imposes tight
constraints on both the boost from substructures and the Sommerfeld
enhancement. These constraints might improve with future more
sensitive Cherenkov telescopes. However considering that an indirect
detection of DM in clusters relies on the boost from substructures
whose main contribution comes from the periphery, we conclude that the
wide angular extent of clusters in gamma-rays on the sky suggest that
these sources are not ideal for Cherenkov telescopes due to the loss
of sensitivity outside the small PSF (BETTER CHECK THIS WITH SOME
EXPERT).

  $0.1\deg$. For this cluster, the boost from Sommerfeld and
  substructures is about 130 and 570, respectively.}
 \label{fig:IR_comp}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure*}

It is also interesting to compare the total contribution from the LP
model, the brightest BM model ($\Kp$), and the CRp induced emission. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:flux_int} we show the integrated flux from Fornax for
our different gamma-ray models and compare it to the unresolved
integrated flux upper limit on Fornax set by Fermi-LAT where they
averaged the flux over the energy range $0.2-100\,\gev$ assuming a
spectral index of 2. Again we are overproducing the upper limits,
although only with a factor 10 which is about a order magnitude less
constraining than the differential flux in the energy range
$1-10$~GeV. From the figure one clearly see that the LP model is
dominating the entire gamma-ray energy range up to the DM mass of this
model of about 1~TeV. In addition it is interesting to note that the
flux the DM BM $\Kp$ model is above the predicted emission from the
CRps in the $1-100$~GeV energy regime accessible both to Fermi and
Cherenkov telescopes.

   cluster using a point spread function of $0.1\deg$. The boost from

 \label{fig:flux_int}
\end{figure}

We continue by comparing the estimated differential flux from Fornax
to three other clusters in Fig.~\ref{fig:clu_comp}; the close by and
well studied Virgo cluster, the X-ray bright Perseus clusters, and the
massive merging Coma cluster. We find high DM induced gamma-ray fluxes
from both the Fornax and Virgo clusters, which highlight them as
promising targets for indirect DM searches. Note, however, that we
have used spatially unresolved upper limits, which is quite optimistic
for the angular extended Virgo cluster. It is quite striking how
constraining the upper limits for the Fornax cluster is compared to
the other clusters, especially in the $1-10$~GeV energy regime where
Fermi-LAT is most sensitive due to the maximized effective area. The
upper limits for Virgo and Perseus are background contaminated by AGN
activity from M87 and NGC 1267, respectively, and do not gain much
from the increased sensitivity. One should also note that the high CRp
induced flux from both Coma and Perseus is of the same magnitude as
the DM flux from LP models, making it difficult for indirect DM
searches in those clusters. Conversely is the Fornax cluster a great
target for indirect DM studies because the relative low gamma-ray flux
from CRps, absents of an active AGN, and high DM gamma-ray
flux. Actually, the Fermi-LAT 3 year data will be able to constrain
the smallest mass of substructures using the DM BM models. We have
also learned that the closest clusters are superior for DM searches
compared to further away clusters, even though the close by clusters
have a mass that is smaller. In fact, we can understand this by
looking at the luminosity-to-mass scaling relations. The gamma-ray
luminosity from the smooth density profile is given by
\begin{equation}
L_{\gamma,\rmn{sm}} \propto \int \dd V \rho(r)^2 \propto \frac{c^3}
{\left[\log\left(1+c\right)-c/(1+c)\right]} \propto \mvir^{0.83}\,,
\end{equation}
and the total DM luminosity including boost factors for the LP and
the BM models are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:LP_scaling}
L_{\gamma,\rmn{LP}} &=& L_{\gamma,\rmn{smLP}} \B_\rmn{LP} \propto \mvir^{0.73}\qquad
\,\,\,\,\,\,\rmn{and}\\
\label{eq:BM_scaling}
L_{\gamma,\rmn{BM}} &=& L_{\gamma,\rmn{smBM}} \B_\rmn{BM} \propto  \mvir^{1.06}\,,\qquad
\rmn{where} \\
B_\rmn{LP}&=&B_\sfe B_\sub \propto \mvir^{-1/3}\mvir^{0.23} \propto
 \mvir^{-0.1}\,,\\
B_\rmn{BM}&=&B_\sub \propto \mvir^{0.23}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Hence increasing the mass with a factor two doubles the luminosity,
but increasing the distance by a factor two decrease the flux with a
factor four. One should also note that the IC on SD photons scales
slightly softer with mass, hence giving rise to a larger fraction of
gamma-rays in low mass clusters compared to the total gamma-ray
flux. In addition, considering that the brightest cluster galaxy
constitute a relative larger contribution to the SD luminosity in low
mass clusters which increase the importance of the SD component in low mass
clusters even more (c.f. Fig.~\ref{fig:IR_comp}).

It is also useful to relate the luminosities to a more model
independent variable as the maximum circular velocity given by

As we have seen in this section the LP models overproduce both the
differential and integrated flux upper limits set by the Fermi-LAT for
several clusters. We can use these upper limits to enforce constraints
on the SFE and boost from substructures. As more sensitive experiments
and better upper limits emerge, we can start ruling out models that
give rise to boost factors that are manifested in the gamma-ray
flux. It is especially interesting is to constrain the SFE, where a
boost of 300 is required to explain the excess of electrons and
positrons observed in the vicinity of Earth by PAMELA/Fermi/HESS.  In
Fig.~\ref{fig:clu_comp} we use the estimated flux from four clusters
to constrain the SFE as well as the minimum mass of substructures
where $M_\rmn{lim}\propto\mvir^{0.226}$. As expected, the Fornax
cluster is the most constraining cluster by far, although the current
upper limits are not good enough to rule out the boost from
substructures or SFE. Assuming that the electron and positron excess
is due to SFE DM matter, then in order not to overproduce the
differential upper limits set by Fermi-LAT in the energy range
$1-10$~GeV \footnote{We average the LP DM flux in the energy range
  $1-10$~GeV before we compare it to the upper limits.}  we can
constrain the smallest mass of substructures to $M_\rmn{lim}\gtrsim
100\,\msun$. Instead assuming the standard mass of the smallest
substructures of $M_\rmn{lim}\gtrsim 10^{-6}\,\msun$, we can constrain
the boost from SFE to about 2 in Fornax, corresponding to a maximum
SFE in the MW of about 5.

\section{Surface brightness profiles}
\label{sect:spatial}
[ADD DUSTY STAR FORMING GALAXIES IN OUTERPARTS (LITTLE OVERLAP), DUST
  WOULD NOT SURVIVE. IF DUST RAMPRESSURE STRIPPED, SPATIALLIATION
  PROCESS IN THE HOT ICM FOR DYNAMICAL TIME] The large angular extent
of clusters on the sky in combination with the small PSF of most
gamma-ray probes ($\sim 0.1$~deg) suggest that we would be able to
probe the different spatial regimes of a cluster. Especially important
is the spatial distribution of the gamma-ray emission as it bias upper
limits derived for spatially extended clusters where a simple density
profile is often assumed. In fact when DM substructures are included
the total brightness profile is almost flat and very different from
the smooth halo distribution with a steep outer brightness slope of
$-5$.

In this section we investigate the gamma-ray surface brightness
profiles induced by both CRps and different models of DM in more
detail. We start by comparing the substructure included brightness
from different clusters in Fig.~\ref{fig:SB_clu}. As expected, we find
that the DM flux in all clusters follow the same smooth universal
shape imposed by the substructures. Even as far in as 1\% of $\rvir$
we are dominated by the substructures, which is due to the projection
of the outer cluster halo (see Sect.~\ref{sect:subst} for a longer
discussion). This implies that the spatial distribution of
annihilating DM induced emission is independent of the type of DM
model, and can not be used to separate different models. The
normalization for the BM model is determined by $\bsub
L_{\gamma,\rmn{BM}}^{1/3} \propto \mvir^{0.5}$, which explains the
factor three difference in normalization between the most massive
cluster Coma and the least massive cluster Fornax with a mass ratio of
about 10. The flux from the LP model show a smaller spread in the
normalization which is due to the additional contribution from SFE
with a negative mass trend, hence a normalization with a softer
mass-scaling of $\sim\mvir^{0.17}$. The surface brightness induced by
CRps mainly trace the gas profile of each cluster with an additional
enhancement in the center due to the expected large population of
CRps, hence we see a much larger spread in these profiles. It is
noticeable that Fornax show such a small surface brightness. However,
it is explained by the low gas density outside the BCG and the less
abundant CRp population in the relative small cluster compared to a
more massive cluster \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. In fact, only the
very inner part of Fornax is dominated by a large gamma-ray flux from
CRps, which however, is neglible compared to the flux withing
$\rvir$. This is the reason why Fornax is such a good target for
indirect DM searches, and competitive to DM searches in dwarf
galaxies. Although, it might be a problem for Cherenkov telescopes
looking for a DM in the center of Fornax.

\begin{figure}

 \caption{\it Comparing the intrinsic surface brightness from
   different clusters without taking PSF effects into account. We show
   the CRp induced emission (red), leptophilic emission (green), and
   emission from the $\Kp$ benchmark model (blue). The different
   linestyles each represent a cluster; Fornax (solid), Coma (dotted),
   Virgo (dashed), and Perseus (dash-dotted). The boost from
   Sommerfeld effect and substructures is about 130 and 570,
   respectively. Notice the very similar shape and normalization of
   the DM models, while the CRps have a much larger scatter in the
   profiles due to the large variation of the gas fraction in these clusters.}
 \label{fig:SB_clu}
\end{figure}

To quantify the impact of substructures on the spatial profiles in
more detail we again turn to the Fornax clusters and show in
Fig.~\ref{fig:SB_sub} a comparison of surface brightness profiles with
and without substructures. It is quite remarkable how flat the
profiles including substructures are compared to the ones
without. This implies that the relative flux within the PSF in the
center is comparable to the outer parts, which should increase the
signal-to-noise significantly. If we assume that substructures for
some reason are suppressed in the Fornax cluster, then the expected
signal from DM is swamped by astrophysical backgrounds over the entire
extent of the cluster, even though Fornax has one of the highest
ratios of DM/CRp gamma-ray brightness.

   lines. The dashed line show the brightness where the boost from

   when substructures are included, and the relative large boost at
   $0.01\rvir$ that is due to projection of peripheral substructures
   onto the cluster center.}
 \label{fig:SB_sub}
\end{figure}

NEED TO REWRITE, JUMPING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN PANELS In order to
learn about the spatial distribution of the DM flux in various
clusters for different DM models and associated gamma-ray components,
we show in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:SB_clu_nosub} the
brightness profiles for the smooth DM distribution for the same four
representative clusters that was shown previously in
Fig.~\ref{fig:SB_clu}. In addition, we show the spatial dependence of
the individual gamma-ray components for the Fornax cluster in the
right panel. We find that the spatial distribution of the DM emission
at 1~GeV in the outer parts of the all clusters have the same
shape. The shape trace the underlying density slope of $-3$, which is
expected for IC upscattered CMB photons. This picture is confirmed by
the components study in the right panel that show the neglible
contribution from the IC upscattered light from SD at this
energy. Since the surface brightness from BM models are dominated by
the continuum emission at each radial bin in all clusters, we see that
the total DM emission follows the projected density profile over the
entire clusters. The LP model, however, give rise to a much flatter
profile in the central parts of the clusters. This is due to the IC
upscattered CMB photons that are upscattered on an electron and
positron population that suffers from efficient cooling on light from
SD. The IC emission from SD photons have a rather steep spectrum in
the center that follows the projected density profile which is
explained by the SD dominated cooling that cancels the spatial
dependence from the SD spectrum. In the left panel we also find some
variation in the profiles for the different clusters in the central
parts. Especially in the Fornax cluster, where we find a factor two
larger flux compared to the other clusters. This is due to more
efficient SD cooling of the dominating IC upscattered CMB photons in
Fornax; a low X-ray luminous cluster has a low energy density in
starlight and dust in our semi-analytic SD model. However, note that
the surface brightness from the SD component is suppresses at the
relative low energy of 1~GeV.  Since there is no enhancement from the
substructures, the overall mass normalization of the LP DM model has a
marginally negative trend $\sim\mvir^{-0.06}$. Hence, we only see a
very small difference in outer parts of the different clusters from
these type of models. The BM DM models have a normalization of
$\sim\mvir^{0.27}$, hence more massive clusters show a slightly higher
surface brightness. As also noticed in previous figure, the flux from
DM without substructures is dominated by the CRp induced emission for
all clusters.

\end{minipage}
\end{figure*}

In Sect.~\ref{sect:spatial} we saw that the spectral distribution of
the gamma-ray flux from the LP model were dominated at high energies
of $100\,$~GeV by final state radiation and the IC upscattered
starlight and dust, while the BM models were mainly dominated by the
continuum emission. These high energies are reachable by both
Fermi-LAT and Cherenkov telescopes, thus important observationally. We
therefore show in Fig.~\ref{fig:SB_IACTs} the surface brightness above
$100\,$~GeV for a realistic PSF of $0.1\deg$ where we include the
boost from substructures. We look at two clusters with an expected
high DM signal; the relative small Fornax cluster and the massive
close by Virgo cluster Both clusters show a very flat brightness
profile within about 10\% of $\rvir$, due to both the effect from
substructures and the smoothening over the PSF. The CRp induced
emission also show a smoothing in the central parts due to the PSF. In
the outer part of the Fornax cluster the CRp flux is suppressed
compared to the substructure boosted DM flux, where the LP model is
over three orders of magnitude larger. Although, it should be noted
that there are large uncertainties in the gas density profile used to
estimate the CRp surface brightness (see Fig.~\ref{fig:dens_fornax}
for more details).

\section{Population studies: flux predictions and observational limits}


In this section, we compute the expected $\gamma$-ray fluxes from DM
annihilation and CR interactions of the brightest clusters of the X-ray flux
complete sample in the local universe. We confront these predictions to upper
limits obtained by Fermi 1.5-year data and conclude on the viability of the
underlying models and perspectives for the next years of Fermi observations.

\subsection{Scaling relations}

\begin{figure*}
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{figures/MLscaling.100M.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{figures/MLscaling.10G.eps}
  \caption{\it Scaling relations of the cluster's virial mass $M_{200}$ and the
    $\gamma$-ray luminosity for energies $E_\gamma>100$~MeV (left) and
    $E_\gamma>10$~GeV (right).  Shown are the relations for the CR-induced
    emission that is dominated by pion decay resulting from hadronic CR
    interactions (solid), the leptophilic model of DM annihilations that
    includes the scaling of the substructure and Sommerfeld boost factors with
    cluster mass from Equation~(\ref{eq:LP_scaling}) (dash-dotted) as well as the
    benchmark model $K'$ of DM annihilation that includes the scaling of the
    substructure boost with cluster mass of Equation~(\ref{eq:BM_scaling})
    (dashed). Note that the scaling of this particular benchmark model is
    indicative for all (non-Sommerfeld enhanced) DM annihilation models while
    the normalization depends on the particular cross-section and neutralino
    mass.}
\label{fig:lum_mass_scaling}
\end{figure*}

First we focus on $\gamma$-ray flux-cluster mass scaling relations for DM
annihilation and CR induced emission in Fig.~\ref{fig:lum_mass_scaling}.  The
mass scaling of the substructure boost steepens the intrinsically shallower DM
annihilation relation of benchmark models (Equation~(\ref{eq:BM_scaling})) while
this steepening is in fact over-compensated by the inverse mass scaling of the
Sommerfeld boost in leptophilic models that prefers smaller halos with a larger
ratio of $c/v_\mathrm{circ}$ (Equation~(\ref{eq:LP_scaling})). In contrast, the
CR scaling relation is considerably steeper as shown by reference
\cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}. {\bf Anders: add CR scaling formula} This implies
already a general strategy to minimize the CR-induced foreground for DM
annihilation and argues for very nearby groups. We note that these simulations
do not include AGN feedback that is thought to furthermore reduce the baryon
fraction in groups relative to that in clusters \cite{2008ApJ...687L..53P}. The
resulting smaller target density for hadronic CR interactions will furthermore
steepen the $L_\gamma-M$ relation of CR induced emission, making the case for
groups even stronger.

    models, although our predictions are approaching the upper limits and will

 \label{fig21}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig14} compares Fermi upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray flux with
predictions of DM annihilation fluxes in the leptophilic and benchmark models.
To obtain the $\gamma$-ray fluxes, we scale the virial mass of clusters in the
extended HIFLUGCS catalogue \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R} with our scaling
relations of Equations~(\ref{eq:BM_scaling}) and (\ref{eq:LP_scaling}). In
Figure~\ref{fig14}, we compare only those clusters of the HIFLUGCS sample with
Fermi limits to our predictions and show the DM flux predictions of the entire
sample in Fig.~\ref{fig21}.  We assume a boost factor due to substructures that
has a constant contribution per decade in substructure mass and has a mass
spectrum extending down to Earth masses. Fermi limits rule out the leptophilic
models in their present form with the mentioned assumptions in 14 clusters, and
limit the boost from Sommerfeld enhancement to less than 4 [?] in
Fornax. Assuming universality, this limits the Sommerfeld boost in the MW to
less than 10 (see Fig.~\ref{fig:boost_const}).  The flux level of the Fermi
limits are an indirect measure of the ambient background flux in the
$\gamma$-ray sky and/or the presence of strong point sources such as AGN in the
immediate vicinity of the cluster position. Hence, the ratio of the Fermi upper
limits to the predicted annihilation fluxes,
$F_{\mathrm{UL}}/F_{\mathrm{scal}}$, is a good indication of the best cluster
candidates for indirect DM experiments. We identify Fornax, M49, NGC4636, and
Virgo to be prime candidates. Note however, that Virgo extends of $7\deg$ over
the sky which implies a lower surface brightness and lower signal-to-noise.
Fermi limits on individual clusters are expected to improve as $\sqrt{T/1.5
  \mathrm{yr}}$, where $T$ is the total elapsed time of the Fermi mission. We
emphasize that the very inhomogeneous distribution of $F_{\mathrm{UL}}/
F_{\mathrm{scal}}$ makes it unlikely to dramatically improve the limits through
a stacking analysis as the weak signal will dilute the average constraints.
Assuming the projected sensitivity of the future Cherenkov telescope array (CTA)
of {\bf Anders: value?}, we note that it will be difficult to detect the DM
annihilation signal from clusters without a Sommerfeld boost by Cherenkov
telescopes. This is because the boost from substructures is extended while the
sensitivity of Cherenkov telescopes drops linearly with radius outside the point
spread function.

\subsection{CR-induced emission}

\begin{figure*}
\begin{minipage}{2.0\columnwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{figures/Fermi.comp.CR.diff.eps}
  \caption{\it We contrast predictions of the CRp induced gamma-ray

    the mean differential flux in the energy range $E_\gamma=1-10$~GeV

    in perfect agreement with the derived upper limits from
    Fermi. Interestingly, the limits of Virgo, Norma, and Coma are
    closing in on our predictions and will enforce constraints on the
    parameters of hadronic models such as shock acceleration
    efficiencies or CR transport properties in the coming years.}
 \label{fig15}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure*}

In Fig.~\ref{fig15}, we compare Fermi-LAT flux upper limits to the
flux predictions by the semi-analytical Pinzke and Pfrommer model
\cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} for CRp induced $\gamma$-rays that uses the
X-ray-inferred density profiles of clusters as an input. For
consistency, we use beta-model fits to ROSAT data of X-ray bright
clusters for our $\gamma$-ray flux estimates
\cite{2002ApJ...567..716R}). We derive the central gas densites for
each cluster by following the approach outlined in
\cite{1999ApJ...517..627M} which assumes that the ICM is
isothermal. The central gas density is found by combining X-ray
temperature with X-ray luminosity, X-ray detection radius, density
core radius and density slope for each cluster. These predictions are
superior to those that use luminosity-mass scaling relation to infer
the expected $\gamma$-ray flux---a method used by reference
\cite{2010ApJ...717L..71A} to compare to Fermi limits.  In this
semi-analytic model, we employ the fact that CRs accelerated at
structure formation shocks and transported over cosmic time exhibit a
universal spectral form and an almost universal spatial
distribution. Depending on whether or not we account for the bias of
``artificial galaxies'' in cosmological simulations, we derive an
optimistic or conservative limit of the expected $\gamma$-ray emission
from decaying pions (bracketing our ignorance of the contribution of
cluster galaxies to the overall $\gamma$-ray flux from a
cluster). Note that both models assume the maximally allowed
acceleration efficiency for strong shocks that transfer 50\% of the
shock kinetic energy to CRs and most likely will have to be corrected
down if this number is not realized at structure formation
shocks. Secondly, these simulations neglect active CR transport such
as streaming and diffusion relative to the gas, i.e. we assume that
advective transport is the dominant one and CRs are tightly coupled to
the gas via flux-frozen magnetic fields tangled on sufficiently small
scales. Evidence from the statistics of radio halos suggests that this
might not be the case for relaxed clusters, arguing that CR streaming
in those objects could be responsible for a decrease in the central CR
number density. This effect would also reduce the expected
$\gamma$-ray flux by up to a factor of five
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}. We note that the tightest Fermi limits are
obtained in the 1-10 GeV regime due to the largest effective area of
LAT there. In this energy band, the Fermi limits come close to the
flux predictions of Virgo, Coma and Norma. Using integrated flux
limits from Fermi, we arrive at very similar results.  We emphasize
that by using our semi-analytic modeling, the slight discrepancy of
the scaling relation-based prediction with the Fermi limit on Norma
\cite{2010ApJ...717L..71A} is resolved: Norma simply seems to be less
bright than an average cluster of the same mass as Norma. The
insensitive limit on Perseus comes about since the central AGN in
NGC1275 has turned on over the last years, making it hard to determine
a comparable limit as obtained from the other clusters.

To complete this section, we present our semi-analytical model
predictions for the CR-induced $\gamma$-ray flux for all clusters in
the extended HIFLUGCS sample in Fig.~\ref{fig19}. In the lower panel
of this figure, we show the relative difference between the
$\gamma$-ray flux predicted by the mass-luminosity scaling relation
and to the flux computed using the semi-analytical model. Using our
semi-analytic modelling results in a scatter of the expected
$\gamma$-ray flux at a given mass. Cool core clusters have a denser
core which increases the target density of gas protons for the
hadronic reaction which in turn biases the expected $\gamma$-ray
fluxes systematically higher. We confirm this effect as all our
outliers with increased flux in our semi-analytic model relative to
the scaling relation expectation are in fact cool core clusters
suggesting that the X-ray emission should be a good proxy for the
expected $\gamma$-ray emission. Note however that there could be the
counter-acting effect of CR streaming in relaxed clusters which would
tend to decrease the $\gamma$-ray luminosity
\cite{2011A&A...527A..99E}. Future careful modelling is needed to
quantify this effect.

star photons the suppression should be at 100~GeV. So the star photons are
definitely KN suppressed, which explains the earlier break and the steeper
slope.

\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we study the possibility for detecting gamma-ray emission in
galaxy clusters. We consider benchmark and leptophilic models of supersymmetric
dark matter as well as cosmic ray induced pion decay which is thought to
dominate the astrophysical signal from clusters. Once supersymmetric cold dark
matter decouples from the expanding universe it streams and erases any
potentially present smaller scales. Once gravitational instabilities causes
halos to collapse, this free-streaming scale imprints as a characteristic
minimum halo mass $M_\mathrm{min}$ into the hierarchy of structure formation and
should still survive until the present time as substructure within larger
halos. It turns out that the boost due to substructures dominates over the
smooth component for halo masses $M>10^3 \msun$ {\bf Anders: check?} and
contributes a constant luminosity for each decade in halo mass. The ratio of
halo-to-minimum subhalo mass $M_{200}/M_\mathrm{min}$ is maximized for the
largest systems that had time to collapse and virialize since the Big Bang --
galaxy clusters. The corresponding substructure boost can reach values exceeding
$10^3$ which should make nearby clusters the brightest DM annihilation sources
after the Milky May center and hypothetical very close-by DM
substructures. Since the number density of substructures are distributed
according to an Einasto profile, the contribution to the annihilation emission
from substructures is dominated from radii close to the virial radius. This
implies an almost flat surface brightness profile of the annihilation emission
which makes it necessary to have the entire cluster in the field-of-view to take
advantage of the entire substructure boost.  This property makes it difficult to
detect DM annihilation emission without an enhancement of the particle physics
cross section over its standard value of $\sigma v\sim 3\times 10^{-26}
~\mathrm{cm}^3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ with imaging air Cherenkov telescopes due to the
spatially extended boost from substructures of angular extend $\sim 0.5-1\deg$
(as independently found by reference \cite{2011arXiv1104.3530S}). In contrast,
the sensitivity of Cherenkov telescopes drops linearly with radius outside the
point spread function $\sim0.1\deg$.

We identify Fornax to be the best cluster/group candidate for indirect DM
studies as it is expected to emit the brightest annihilation flux and more
importantly, has a comparably low CR induced gamma-ray flux.  This in principle
should allow to detect or constrain some benchmark models that have been chosen
for the large gamma-ray flux yield with three-year Fermi data (or constrain the
substructure boost factor). Other nearby bright sources of the extended HIFLUGCS
sample of nearby bright X-ray cluster/groups are M49, Centaurus, and NGC~4636.
The non-detection of gamma-ray emission by Fermi in a total of 14
clusters/groups (the mentioned clusters as well as Virgo, Coma, Hydra, and Norma
among others) considerably constrains leptophilic models for DM annihilation
which were introduced to explain the increasing positron-to-lepton ratio beyond
10 GeV. Assuming that the minimum DM substructure mass extends down to an Earth
mass, we can rule out these leptophilic models based on the non-observation of
gamma-rays in any of the fore-mentioned clusters/groups. Alternatively, assuming
the leptophilic models to be correct, we limit the minimum substructure mass to
$>100~\msun$ in Fornax. Assuming universality of the DM model, this corresponds
to a minimum substructure mass of $5\times 10^4~\msun$ {\bf Anders: check value} in
the Milky Way due to the larger Sommerfeld boost factor in smaller mass halos
which have a lower circular velocity which enhances the particle cross section.

In this work, we thoroughly study the spectral emission characteristics of the
DM emission. In general there are different radiation mechanism that emit in the
gamma-ray regime, namely (i) continuum emission following the hadronization of
the annihilating neutralinos in benchmark models which leads to the production
of charged and neutral mesons which decay finally into electrons, neutrinos, and
gammas, (ii) inverse Compton (IC) emission by the leptons in the final state
which up-scatter radiation fields from the cosmic microwave background, dust,
and starlight, and (iii) final state radiation or internal bremsstrahlung which
dominates the highest energy emission close to the rest mass of the
self-annihilating neutralinos (if present in the model under
consideration). While this final state radiation is sometimes not distinguished
from the continuums emission contribution, we keep it separate as it dominates
the very high-energy tail of the gamma-ray spectrum in leptophilic models while
there the continuums emission is negligibly low. 

For the first time we compute the inverse Compton emission component not only
from the upscattered CMB photons but also from a realistically modeled photon
field due to dust and starlight extending from infra red to optical
wavelengths. To this end, we construct a rather simple semi-analytic model for
the spatial and spectral distribution of dust and starlight in clusters which
can be used for the annihilation emission in galaxies with a different spatial
profile.  We find that in benchmark models, the continuum emission dominates
over the IC emission of any available radiation field. In the leptophilic
models, where the continuum emission is low, the IC up-scattering of the CMB
dominates below 60 GeV. For large clusters, the final state radiation takes then
over for energies up to the cutoff at $m_\chi c^2 \sim 1$~TeV. In small
clusters, there is a window around $E_\gamma \sim 100~\mathrm{GeV}$ where the IC
up-scattering of the dust emission dominates over the CMB IC emission and the
final state radiation. The IC emission of starlight remains always subdominant.
We stress, that the inclusion of the dust and starlight radiation fields are
negligible in the cooling function for the leptons.  The main reason why the IC
emission from starlight and dust remains subdominant is the small overlap of
this component with the peripherally peaked substructure mass density
profiles. If for some reason, dark matter has less substructure, the relative
importance of this inverse Compton component increases considerably.

We substantially improve the modelling of the expected gamma-ray signal from
pion-decay resulting from hadronic CR interactions with gas protons over
previous work \citep{2010ApJ...717L..71A}. We employ the semi-analytic model of
the CR spectrum and spatial distribution, recently developed by
\citet{2010MNRAS.409..449P} that is based on cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations that self-consistently follow the evolution of CRs in cosmic
structure formation. Adopting the model for all clusters in the HIFLUGCS sample
of flux-limited X-ray clusters, we compare the expected gamma-ray emission to
that inferred from using $L_\gamma$-cluster mass scaling relation. We note that
the predictions of our ``optimistic'' model are perfectly in agreement with
Fermi upper limits for all clusters.  The hint of a tension that the scaling
relation modeling showed for Norma \citep{2010ApJ...717L..71A} could not be
confirmed due to the apparently lower gas density of this cluster relative to
the average.  As expected, the semi-analytic model adds ``scatter'' to the
scaling relation and biases the gamma-ray flux high for prominent cool core
clusters by up to a factor of 3.5 relative to the expectation from the scaling
relation. This is due to the high target gas densities and associated CR
densities in those cool cores that shape the spatial emission characteristic to
be very similar to that observed in thermal X-rays. We caution that these
predictions only apply for the case of negligible active CR transport such as
streaming and diffusion relative to the gas and might be considerably modified
in those cluster that do not show an extended diffuse radio(-mini) halo that
might point to a centrally concentrated CR distribution
\citep{2011A&A...527A..99E}. The CR spectrum $E^2 dN/dE$ shows the
characteristic pion bump at energies around 1~GeV. It is expected to dominate
the DM annihilation signal in the benchmark models for all clusters/groups but
Fornax. We conclude that it will be possible to rule out the leptophilic model
with eight-years of Fermi data {\bf Anders: check} and start to constrain some
benchmark DM models. Hence this should nicely complement direct and accelerator
searches for the nature of dark matter.

\section{Detailed modelling of  starlight and dust in clusters}


\subsection{Energy spectrum}

Our goal in this section is to derive a simple spectral model for SD
in galaxy clusters. The SD light from clusters is dominated by the
emission from galaxies. This radiation is expected to leak out into
the much larger volume of the ICM, hence we approximate the spectral
distribution of the ICL with the light from galaxies. We use the far
infrared to ultraviolet spectrum derived in \cite{2006ApJ...648L..29P}
for a MW type galaxy to characterize the SD spectral distribution of a
cluster. Note that we only keep the spectral shape, and renormalize
the spectral distribution using the luminosity from SD.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:SD_spectra} we show the spectral distribution of the
light from SD together with the CMB black-body distribution in a
galaxy cluster, both at the radius $r=0.02\rvir$ where the energy
density of the smooth light from SD (see Fig.~\ref{fig:SD_Edens})
equals the energy density of the CMB. We have renormalized both the
spectral data and the fitted spectra using the luminosity from stars
and dust individually.

We choose to fit the spectrum of the dust that peaks at about
$10^{-2}\,\ev$ with a double power-law, and the slightly wider
spectral distribution of the stars that peaks at about $1\,\ev$ with a
tipple power-law. We find the best fit spectra for the SD in a
cluster through:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \eph^2\frac{\dd^2 N_\ph}{\dd \eph \dd V}
  &\equiv& u_\sd(\eph) =  \sum_i N_i(\mvir) u_i^\gal(\eph)\,,\nonumber \\ 
\rmn{where}\quad i&=&\{\rmn{stars,dust}\} \qquad \rmn{and}\\ 
% &=&  N_\dust(\lx) u_\dust^\gal(\eph) + N_\stars(\lx) u_\stars^\gal(\eph)  \nonumber \\ 
%  \\
  u_\stars^\gal(\eph) &=& \frac{23\,\rmn{eV}}{\rmn{cm}^3} 
  \left(\frac{1.23\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{1.9} \nonumber \\
  &\times&\left[1+\left(\frac{2.04\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{20}\right]
  ^{-\frac{1.9}{20}}\nonumber \\
  &\times& \left[1+\left(\frac{0.78\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{20}\right]^{-\frac{2.6}{20}}\,, \\
  u_\dust^\gal(\eph) &=& 
  \frac{40\,\rmn{eV}}{\rmn{cm}^3} 
  \left(\frac{0.0144\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{4.9}\nonumber \\
  &\times& \left[1+\left(\frac{0.0144\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{1.9}\right]^{-4.9}\,.
\end{eqnarray}

The spatial and spectral distribution functions of the light from SD
in a cluster are both normalized with a mass dependent function
determined from the luminosity in each respective wavelength band. The
specific energy density is given by
\begin{eqnarray} 
u_\sd(\eph, r) &=& j(r)\,u_\sd(\eph) \nonumber\\
&=& j(r)\,\sum_i N_i(\mvir) u_i^\gal(\eph)\,,
\label{eq:u_SD}
\end{eqnarray}
where $j(r)$ describes the spatial distribution. We fix the unitless
normalization $N_i(\mvir)$ using the total energy of the light in SD
within $\rvir$:
\begin{eqnarray} 
  E_{i,\vir} &=& L_i \frac{\rvir}{c} \nonumber \\
  &=&N_i(\mvir)\int_{\rvir} \int_i \,j(r) 
  \frac{u_i^\gal(\eph)}{\eph}\,\dd V\dd \eph\,,\nonumber \\
 \rmn{for}\quad i&=&\{\rmn{stars,dust}\}\,.
\label{eq:E_SD}
\end{eqnarray}
Here we approximate the total energy of the photons within $\rvir$
($E_{i,\vir}$) with the luminosity $L_i$ \cite{2008A&A...490..547G}
times the typical timescale it takes for a photon to propagate through
the cluster (we assume that the cluster is optically thin). We derive
the luminosity from the stars using
\begin{eqnarray}
L_\stars(M_{200\rmn{av}})&=&10^{\frac{m_\odot-m_\rmn{cl}-2.5\log\left(1+z\right)}{2.5}}
\left(\frac{D_\clu}{D_\odot}\right)^2 L_\odot\nonumber\\
&\approx& 5.3\times10^{44}\,\rmn{erg}\,\rmn{s}^{-1}\,,
\label{eq:L_star}
\end{eqnarray}
where the average apparent magnitude of a cluster at $z\approx 0.25$
in the $(r+i)$-band is given by $m_\rmn{cl}\approx 15.5$
\cite{2005MNRAS.358..949Z}. This magnitude is derived from stacking
clusters observed by the SDSS with the average mass
$M_{200\rmn{av}}=4.0\times10^{13}\msun$ and redshift close to
$z=0.25$. We also use an apparent magnitude of the sun $m_\odot\approx
-27.7$, distance to the sun $D_\odot=4.85\times10^{-6}\,\rmn{pc}$,
luminosity of the sun $L_\odot=1.17\times10^{33}\,\rmn{erg\,s}^{-1}$,
and distance to the cluster $D_\clu=1.26\times10^9\,\rmn{pc}$. To
account for different cluster masses in our analysis we adopt a simple
mass scaling of the luminosity from the stars in clusters. Since a
large contribution of the total starlight in a cluster comes from the
brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), we assume that the total starlight has
the same halo mass scaling as the BCG \cite{2010ApJ...713.1037H}
\begin{equation}
L_\stars(\mvir)=L_\stars(M_{200\rmn{av}})\,
\left(\frac{\mvir}{M_{200\rmn{av}}}\right)^{0.18}\,.
\end{equation} 
We can now fix the normalization constant for the stars in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:E_SD}) by integrating over the cluster volume and
spectral distribution of the stars. It is given by
\begin{equation}
 N_\stars(\mvir) = 2.1\times10^{33}\,
\left(\frac{\mvir}{M_{200\rmn{av}}}\right)^{0.18}\,
\frac{\rvir}{\int_{\rvir} j(r) \,\dd V}\,.
\label{eq:N_stars}
\end{equation}
\del{Note that since the luminosities include the contribution from
galaxies, we have integrated the spatial distribution including
galaxies to derive the normalization. Once the normalization is fixed,
the SD energy densities are derived from the spatial distribution
where galaxies have been excluded.}

The luminosity from the dust is derived from the the luminosity to
richness scaling relation found in \cite{2008A&A...490..547G}
$L_\dust=10^{44.8}\left(\frac{N_{200}}{10}\right)^{0.8}$. We pick a high
richness $N_{200}=82$ cluster to normalize the luminosity since they
are less likely biased by chance coincidences. This richness roughly
correspond to $\mvir=6.0\times10^{14}\,\msun$
\cite{2010ApJ...713.1037H}. Assuming that the dust scales with halo
mass in the same way as the stars, we get
\begin{equation}
L_\stars(\mvir)=L_\stars(M_{200\rmn{av}})\,
\left(\frac{\mvir}{M_{200\rmn{av}}}\right)^{0.18}\,.
\end{equation} 
The normalization constant for the dust in Eq.~(\ref{eq:E_SD}) can now
be determined:
\begin{equation}
 N_\dust(\mvir) =\,
\left(\frac{\mvir}{M_{200\rmn{av}}}\right)^{0.18}\,
\frac{\rvir}{\int_{\rvir} j(r) \,\dd V}\,.
\label{eq:N_dust}
\end{equation}

The spatial distribution of the SD energy density is an important quantity since
it impacts the steady state electron and positron spectra through cooling. A
higher density of SD in a cluster suppresses the spectra of the upscattering
particles. With the formalism presented above, we can now derive the energy
density from starlight and dust in a galaxy cluster through
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:U_SD}
u_\sd(r) &=& \int \dd \eph \frac{\dd^2 N_\ph}{\dd \eph \dd V}\,\eph
=\int \dd \eph \frac{u_\sd(\eph, r)}{\eph}
\nonumber \\
&=&  j(r)  \int \dd \eph \sum_i 
N_i(\mvir) \frac{u_i^\gal(\eph)}{\eph}\,. \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:SD_Edens} we compare the energy densities from
different radiation fields in a galaxy cluster with the mass
$\mvir=4.0\times10^{13}\msun$. We use two different profiles for the
SD energy density, where the total profile includes the contribution
from the ICL, the BCG and all the galaxies, while the galaxies are
excluded in the smooth profile. We find that even for a cluster with a
relative small mass the energy density of the SD components dominates
over the CMB and the magnetic fields (with a central B field of 3~$\mu
G$) within about 10\% of $\rvir$. Outside this radius the CMB is
dominating the energy density of the cluster, hence the magnetic
fields are always subdominant in the cluster and can safely be removed
from cluster IC calculations for a reasonable central B-field and
spectral index. Note that in this work we keep the contribution
from B-fields to the total energy density for consistency.


\subsection{Radial profiles}
ADD CALCULATION ABOUT GALAXY OVERLAP WITH THE ICM
\begin{figure}%[t]
 \includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{figures/SB.photon.eps}
 \caption{\it Surface brightness profiles of the $r$-band ($h\nu\sim
   1\,\ev$) obtained from stacked clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky
   Survey (SDSS) at the redshift $z \sim 0.25$
   \cite{2005MNRAS.358..949Z}. {\bf Anders, this is not clear: The
     brightness profiles have been weighted with the $\rvir$
     normalized area inside radius $r$, and trace the radial
     dependence of the luminosity from stars and galaxies.}  The
   crosses show the total observed starlight including the diffuse
   intracluster (ICL), the galaxies, and the brightest cluster galaxy
   (BCG) in the center of the cluster. The diamonds denote the smooth
   part of the observed starlight from the ICL and the BCG. The solid
   line show the fit to the data of the total light including the ICL,
   the BCG, and the galaxies, while the smooth component is
   represented by the dashed line that is fitted to only the ICL and
   the BCG.}
 \label{fig:SD_spatial}
\end{figure}
Our goal in this section is to derive a simple spatial model for the
distribution of SD in galaxy clusters. For this reason we use stacked
cluster observations by Sloan in the $r$ and $i$-band that trace the
stars. For simplicity we assume that the dust trace the stars in the
clusters [WHY IS THIS A GOOD APPROXIMATION]. The stacked surface
brightness profiles in \cite{2005MNRAS.358..949Z} are measured at
redshift $z \sim 0.25$ with an average mass of the clusters of
$4.0\times10^{13}\,\msun$. The profiles are build up out of three
components; diffuse intracluster light (ICL), galaxies, and the
brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the center of clusters. However, the
total volume overlap of the ISM to the cluster is very small compared
to the ICL- and BCG overlap with the cluster, thus the relative
contribution of the galaxies to the IC emission is suppressed. To
remove this bias we cut out the galaxies that have been smoothed over
the cluster in the stacked analysis. In Fig.~\ref{fig:SD_spatial} we
show the SDSS stacked brightness profiles as well as the fitted
profiles\footnote{The measured brightness is converted into units of
  $\rmn{erg}\,\rmn{s}^{-1}$ using \cite{2010...book}
  $S(\rmn{mag}\,''^{-2}) =
  \mathcal{M}_\odot+21.572-2.5\rmn{log}_{10}S(L_\odot\,\rmn{pc}^{-2})$,
  where the sun's absolute magnitude in the $r$-band is given by
  $\mathcal{M}_\odot=27.1$ \cite{1998gaas.book.....B} and the
  luminosity of the sun by $L_\odot=3.85\,10^{33}
  \rmn{erg}\,\rmn{s}^{-1}$.}, both scaled with the unitless $\rvir$
normalized area to resemble the expected luminosity at radius
$r$. Our benchmark spatial model is shown with the solid black line,
and include the contribution from the ICL and BCG.

Instead of modelling the surface brightness with a de Vaucouleur
profile with the addition of a power-law, we use a double beta profile
model for simplicity of deprojection given by:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{S}_\sd (r_\bot) = \frac{S_\sd (r_\bot)}{S_\rmn{SD}^\rmn{tot}(0)} = 
\sum_{i=1}^2 \,S_i\, 
\left[1 + \left( \frac{r_\bot}{r_{\mathrm{c}_i}}\right)^2\right]
^{-3\beta_i + 1/2}\,,
\label{double_beta}
\end{equation}
where we found the following best fitted normalized central brightness
($S_i$), core radius ($r_{\mathrm{c}_i}$), and slope ($\beta_i$) for
the total model:
\begin{align}
&\tilde{S}_1^\rmn{tot} = 1.0\,,
&&r_{\mathrm{c}_1}^\rmn{tot} = 1.8\,\rmn{kpc}\,,
&&&\beta_1^\rmn{tot} = 0.45\, \nonumber\\
&\tilde{S}_2^\rmn{tot} = 2.3\times10^{-3}\,,
&&r_{\mathrm{c}_2}^\rmn{tot} = 0.19\,\rvir\,,
&&&\beta_2^\rmn{tot} = 0.44\,.\nonumber\\
& && &&&
\label{fit_spatial_IR}
\end{align}
and for the smooth model
\begin{align}
&\tilde{S}_1^\rmn{sm}=0.47,\,
&&r_{\mathrm{c}_1}^\rmn{sm}=3.9\,\rmn{kpc}\,,
&&&\beta_1^\rmn{sm}=0.53 \,\nonumber\\
&\tilde{S}_2^\rmn{sm}=8.3\times10^{-4}\,,
&&r_{\mathrm{c}_2}^\rmn{sm}=0.19\,\rvir\,,
&&&\beta_2^\rmn{sm}=0.54\,.\nonumber\\
& && &&&
\label{fit_spatial_IR}
\end{align}
The 3D spatial profile is derived by deprojecting the surface
brightness in Eq.~(\ref{double_beta}) (see
e.g. \cite{2004A&A...413...17P} for details about the deprojection):
\begin{eqnarray}
  j(r)  = \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{\tilde{S}_i}{2\pi\,r_{\mathrm{c}_i}}\,
  \frac{6 \beta_i - 1}{\left(1 + r^2/r^2_{\mathrm{c}_i}\right)^{3\beta_i}}\,
  \mathcal{B}\left(\frac{1}{2},3\beta_i\right)\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathcal{B}(a,b)$ denotes the beta-function
\cite{1965hmfw.book.....A}.
