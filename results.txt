--) the flux from annihilating DM is boosted by about a factor 1000 in
   clusters
--) flat surface brightness profiles with substructures
--) Fornax is a great target for indirect DM studies because the relative
   low flux from CRs and high flux from DM
--) the IC upscattered photons from stars and dust are dominated in the
   relevant energy regimes by the continuum emission for our DM
   benchmark models
--) Fermi 3 year data will constrain the smallest mass of substructures
   using the benchmark models
--) difficult to detect DM without a Sommerfeld boost with Cherenkov
   telescopes since the boost from substructures is extended while the
   sensitivity of Cherenkov telescopes drops linearly with radius
   outside the point spread function (CHECK)
--) we rule out the leptophilic models in present form in 14 clusters,
   and limit the boost from Sommerfeld enhancement in the MW to less
   than 10
--) the tightest limits on DM and CRs from Fermi are in the 1-10 GeV
   regime, where Fornax, M49, and NGC4636 are the most constraining
   "clusters" for the DM and Virgo, Coma and Norma are very close to the
   predictions for the CRs
--) we provide a rather simple model to calculate the spatial and spectral
   distribution of dust and stars in cluster (might be used for
   galaxies? with different spatial profile)
--) stacking clusters do not improve the limits on DM much
