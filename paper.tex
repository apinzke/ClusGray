\section{Introduction}

Dark matter has been searched for in direct detection experiments
\cite{Pato:2010zk}, at accelerators
\cite{Ellis:2001hv,Baer:2006ff,Khachatryan:2011tk} and also in
indirect detection experiments looking for signals in the cosmic-ray
spectra of antiprotons, positrons, neutrinos and all of the
electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays
\cite{Bergstrom:2009ib}. So far, the improvements in direct detection
sensitivity have put this method into focus, but the situation may
change considerably the coming few years as the CERN LHC experiments
collect data, and new gamma-ray detectors are being planned, such as
the CTA \cite{Consortium:2010bc}. In fact, it has recently been
pointed out \cite{Bergstrom:2010gh} that a dedicated ground-based
gamma-ray detector would have potential that goes far beyond that of
the other methods, depending on presently unknown parameters in the
particle physics models for dark matter.


Among the astrophysical systems which will be very interesting to
detect, and study, with coming gamma-ray detectors (Fermi, HESS,
MAGIC, VERITAS, and eventually large detectors like CTA) belong galaxy
clusters. The most promising directions in which to search for a
gamma-ray annihilation signal (from the annihilation process itself,
and also the accompanying bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton
components coming from charged particles produce in the annihilations)
are basically three:

1. The galactic centre (g.c.). This is where all numerical simulations
of cold dark matter predict the highest density. However, the detailed
dark matter density in the very central part is difficult to predict,
due a to a possibly very complicated interplay between baryons, dark
matter, and the central galactic black hole. Also, it is a very
crowded region with many gamma-ray sources like pulsars and other
supernova recants, which have to be subtracted from the data to
extract the dark matter induced signal. In fact, there is a recent
claim of an indication of a relatively light dark matter particle
contribution to the gamma-ray flux from the
g.c. \cite{2010arXiv1010.2752H}, but other hypotheses seem to work at
least as well \cite{2010arXiv1012.5839B}.

2. The dwarf spheroidal galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, like Segue-1,
Ursa Minor, Draco, Sagittarius, Sculptor, Carina or Willman-1
\cite{2009JCAP...01..016B,2010ApJ...720.1174A,2010JCAP...01..031S,2010JCAP...01..031S}. The
problem here is that the nature of many of these small, dark
matter-dominated galaxies is not entirely clear, and the velocity
dispersion estimates are based on rather small numbers of stars. Tidal
disruption and confusion with star clusters are other
complications. Thus the dark matter density profile is very uncertain
for most of them. Nonetheless, by stacking the data together from many
dwarf spheroidals these uncertainties can be made less severe, and
preliminary results from Fermi-LAT shows this method to give quite
promising results \cite{garde}.

3. Galaxy clusters. This possibility has been less studied, however we
noted in a previous Letter \cite{2009PhRvL.103r1302P} that the are
certain advantages that work in favour of this possible target for
gamma-ray detection of dark matter annihilation.  Galaxy clusters
constitute the most massive objects in our Universe that are forming
today. This causes their DM subhalo mass function to be less affected
by tidal stripping compared to galaxy sized halos that formed long
ago.  The annihilation luminosities of the DM halo component for
e.g. the Virgo cluster and the Draco dwarf scales in a way (see
\cite{2009PhRvL.103r1302P}) that the ratio of gamma-ray luminosities
from the smooth components is around 4, in favour of Virgo. In
addition, there may be a further enhancement due to substructure,
which to a large extent should be unaffected by tidal disruption, at
least in the outer regions.  According to a recent estimate
\cite{2011MNRAS.410.2309G}, more massive haloes tend to have a larger
mass fraction in subhalos.  For example, cluster size haloes typically
have 7.5 per cent of the mass within $r_{200}$ in substructures of
fractional mass larger than $10^{-5}$, which is 25 per cent higher
than galactic haloes \footnote{All halo masses and length scales in
  this paper are scaled to the currently favored value of Hubble's
  constant, $H_0 = 70\, \rm{km~s}^{-1}\,\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We define the
  virial mass $\mvir$ and virial radius $\rvir$ as the mass and radius
  of a sphere enclosing a mean density that is 200 times the critical
  density of the Universe $\rho_{\rm{cr}}$.}.

For a satellite dwarf galaxy, however, once it is accreted by the
Milky Way, the outer regions are severely affected by tidal
stripping. The longer a satellite has been part of our Galaxy, and the
closer it comes to the center during its pericentral passage, the more
material is removed \cite{2004MNRAS.355..819G}.

In this paper, we will investigate in some more detail the potential
of several of the most promising galaxy clusters to yield an
annihilation gamma-ray yield which could be observable with present
and planned gamma-ray detectors.

For previous work related to dark matter in clusters, see, e.g.,
\cite{2006A&A...455...21C,2009PhRvD..80b3005J}.

observations, Perseus ($\mvir=7.7\times10^{14}\,\msun$) for CR induced

\section{Theory}
\label{sect:theory}

\subsection{Astrophysics}
\label{sect:AP}

The differential photon flux within a given solid angle $\Delta
\Omega$ along a line-of-sight (los) is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dflux}
\frac{\dd \fg}{\dd \eg} \equiv \frac{\dd^3 \ngamma}{\dd A \,\dd t\, \dd
  \egamma} = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Delta\Omega} \dd\psi \sin\psi \frac{\dd \sg}{\dd \eg}(\psi,\eg)\,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dtildeflux}
\frac{\dd \sg}{\dd \eg}(\psi,\eg) = \int_{\Delta\Omega} \dd\Omega \int_{\rm los}
\dd l\, q_{\rm sum}\left(\eg,r\right)\Lambda(\theta)\,,
\end{equation}
and $\sg(\psi, >\eg)$ denotes the surface brightness above the photon
energy $\eg$.  The integration along the line-of-sight $l$, in the
direction $\psi$ that the detector is pointing, is parameterized such
that the radius of the source $r=\sqrt{l^2+D^2-2Dl\cos\Psi}$, where
$D$ is the distance to the source from the galactic center and
$\cos\Psi\equiv\cos\theta\cos\psi-\cos\varphi\sin\theta\sin\psi$. The
angular integration $\dd \Omega= \sin\theta\dd \theta \,\dd \varphi$
is performed over a cone centered around $\psi$ and the opening angle
$\Delta \Omega$ is typically taken to be a few times the point spread
function (PSF) $\psf$. The limited angular resolution results in a
probability that a photon coming from a direction $\psi$' is instead
reconstructed to a direction $\psi$, where the underlying probability
distribution follow a Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
\Lambda(\theta)=\frac{1}{2\pi\psf^2}
\,\rmn{exp}\left[-\frac{\theta^2}{2\psf^2}\right]\,,
\quad \rmn{where}\quad \theta=\psi'-\psi \,.
\end{equation}
We denote the total source function by $q_{\rm sum}(\eg,r)$, where we
include contributions from four main processes; leptophilic DM
annihilating to $\mu^+/\mu^-$ decaying to $\rm{e}^+/\rm{e}^-$ pairs
that up-scatter background photons (IC), leptophilic DM emitting final
state radiation (FSR), DM benchmark models where neutralino
annihilations generate electrons that up-scatter background photons
(BM-IC) and emit a continuum as well as final state radiation
(BM-Cont), and CR induced $\pi^0$:s decaying into gamma-rays. The
source function is given by
\begin{equation}
q_\rmn{sum} (\eg,r) = q_{\pi^0-\gamma}(\eg,r)+
\sum_i \,q_{\rmn{sm},i}(\eg,r)\,\B_{\rmn{tot},i}(\sigv,r)
\end{equation}
where $ q_{\pi^0-\gamma}(\eg,r)$ denotes the CR to gamma-ray source
function (see Sect.~\ref{sect:CRs} and \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P}
for more details). The total differerntial boost factor for DM is the
product of enhancement factors from SFE $\B_\sfe(\sigv)$ (see
Sect.~\ref{sect:LP}) and from substructure enhancement over the
smooth halo contribution $\B_{\sub,i}(r) = 1+q_\sub(r)/q_{\rmn{sm},i}(r)$
(see Sect.~\ref{sect:subst}) and is denoted by
$\B_{\rmn{tot},i}(r,\sigv) = \B_\sfe(\sigv)\,\B_{\sub,i}(r)$. The DM
source function from the smooth halo for each process is written on
the form:
\begin{equation}
\quad q_{\rmn{sm},i} (\egamma,r) = \sum_j
\frac{\dd \ngammaj}{\dd E_\gamma} \Gamma_j(r)\,.
\end{equation}
We represent the annihilation rate density with $\Gamma_j =
(\rho/\mx)^2 \, \sigmaannv_j/2$, where $j$ runs over all $\gamma$-ray
producing channels each with the spectrum $\frac{\dd
  \ngammaj}{\dd\eg}$ and annihilation cross-section $\sigmaannv_j$.
The DM density is modeled by an Einasto density profile
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm ein}(r) = \rho_{-2}\,\exp\left\{-\frac{2}{\alpha}
  \left[\left(\frac{r}{r_{-2}}\right)^\alpha -1 \right] \right\},\,
\alpha=0.17 \,,
\end{equation}
that is slightly shallower than the conventional Navaro-Frenk-White
(NFW) profile in the center, but provide a better fit to simulated DM
halos \cite{2010MNRAS.402...21N}. We denote the density where the
profile has a slope of $-2$ by $\rho_{-2}$, and the radius by
$r_{-2}$. Assuming that all the flux from an NFW profile originate
from within the scale radius $\rs=\rvir/c$, and all the flux from an
Einasto profile originate within $r_{-2}=\rvir/c$, it follows that
$\rho_{-2} = \rhos/4$. The virial radius $\rvir$ of a halo is defined
to be the radius at which the mean density within is a factor
$\Delta=200$ times the critical density $\rhoc$ of the universe. The
characteristic density of the NFW profile $\rhos=(\Delta\rhoc/3)\,
c^3/(\log(1+c)-(c/(1+c)))$, where the halo mass dependent
concentration parameter $c$ is derived from a power-law fit to
cosmological simulations with $\mvir \gtrsim 10^{10} \msun$
\cite{2008MNRAS.391.1940M},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cfit}
  c=3.56 \times \left(\frac{\mvir}{10^{15}\,\msun}\right)^{-0.098}\,.
\end{equation}
This mass scaling agrees well with \cite{2009ApJ...707..354Z} for
cluster-mass halos after converting the concentration definitions
according to \cite{2003ApJ...584..702H}.

\subsubsection{Substructures}
\label{sect:subst}
High-resolution DM simulations of the Milky Way (MW) find vast amount
of substrucures in the periphery of DM halos. Since the rate of which
DM is annihilating depends on the density squared, the resulting flux
is boosted compared to the smooth density distribution. Recent
simulations suggest a boost from substructures of the order of ten up
to a few 100 \cite{2008MNRAS.391.1685S, 2008JPhCS.125a2008K} for a MW
size halo. Based on the result from \cite{2008Natur.456...73S}, we
find the best fit\footnote{Our approach of fitting the scaling
  behavior of $\rmn{L_{sub}}(<r)$ directly from numerical simulations
  self-consistently accounts for the radial dependence of the
  substructure concentration \cite{2008MNRAS.391.1685S}.} to the
luminosity from smooth substructures (i.e. substructures within
substructures are not included) inside radius $r$ with
\begin{equation}
  {\rm L_{sub}}(<r)= 0.76\,C_1\,C_2(\mvir)\,{\rm L_{200sm}}\,x^{0.95
    \displaystyle{x}^{-0.27}}\,,
  \label{eq:LSub}
\end{equation}
where ${\rm L_{200sm}}$ is the luminosity from the smooth halo without
substructures within $\rvir$ and $x=
\left(\frac{r}{\rvir}\right)$. The first normalization constant is
given by
\begin{equation}
  C_1=\left(\frac{M_{\rm res,sim}}{M_{\rm lim}}\right)^{0.226}\,,
   \label{eq:C1}
\end{equation}
where $M_{\rm res,sim}=10^5\msun$ is the minimum subhalo mass in the
MW simulation, and $M_{\rm lim}$ the free streaming mass. Here we
assume that the power-law scaling relation in Eq.~(\ref{eq:C1}) is
valid down to the minimum mass of DM halos, which is conventionaly in
the cold dark matter universe
\cite{2001PhRvD..64h3507H,2005JCAP...08..003G} taken to be
$10^{-6}\msun$. Note that potentially the power-law could flatten
torwards smaller mass scales although current simulations show no hits
of such a behaviour and in addition we are approaching the asymptotic
behavior in the power spectrum on these scales(CHECK). For DM halos
more (less) massive than the MW we expect a larger (smaller) boost
from substructures, simply because of the larger (smaller) mass range
down to the minimum mass $M_\rmn{lim}$. We capture this halo mass
dependence with the second normalization in Eq.~(\ref{eq:LSub}):
\begin{equation}
C_2(\mvir)=\left(\frac{\mvir}{M_{\rm 200sim}}\right)^{0.226}\,,
 \label{eq:C2}
\end{equation}
where $M_{\rm 200,sim}=1.9\times10^{12}\msun$ is the mass of the MW
halo in the simulation \cite{2008Natur.456...73S}. 

large uncertaint observationally in density profiles

In Fig.~\ref{fig:radial_lum} we compare the radial dependence of the
accumulative luminosity from different smooth cluster density profiles
to the substructure boosted luminosity at different mass scles. The

  contributions. The solid lines show the accumulative smooth
  luminosity from a cluster with the mass $\mvir=10^{15}\,\msun$ for
  three different density profiles; an Einasto profile with
  $\alpha=0.17$ (light blue), a cuspy NFW profile with $\beta=1.0$
  (dark blue), and a core NFW profile with $\beta=0.6$ (purple). The

  three different mass scales; an $\mvir=10^{15}\,\msun$ galaxy

  $\mvir=10^{8}\,\msun$ dwarf galaxy (green). All luminosities have
  been normalized with the luminosity within $\rvir$ from a cuspy NFW
  profile. Note the large expected boost from substructures in
  clusters ($\sim1000$), and the relative small boost in dwarf
  galaxies ($\sim20$).}

    the emissivity from substructures for the same three mass
    scales. All emissivities have been normalized with the luminosity

\subsubsection{Cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission}
\label{sect:CRs}
The formation process of a galaxy cluster is a very energetic
processes that induces both turbulence as well as frequently occurring
merging and accretion shocks. These processes are thought to
accelerate large quantities of relativistic non-thermal electrons and
protons to high energies. On smaller scales, such as galaxies, there
is convincing evidence of such non-thermal populations. Especially, in
the MW, the cosmic rays are observed directly as well as indirectly
through radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission. On larger scales of the
order of few 100 kpc up to Mpc, there are a vast number of
observations of radio emission coming from radio mini halos in the
center of cooling flow clusters, radio relics in the periphery of
clusters \cite{2004rcfg.proc..335K} as well smooth giant radio halos
that have been observed in more than 50 clusters
\cite{2003ASPC..301..143F,2008SSRv..134...93F}. Most of this observed
radio emission is expected to emerge from synchrotron emitting
cosmic-ray electrons whose precise origin in especially relics and
giant radio halos is still not settled. However, due to the smoothness
of the extended emission and the observed power-law slope it seems
quite natural that they are of hadronic origin. Especilly since the
long cooling time of cosmic ray protons (CRs) allows for both an
extended and large population of CRs to build up over the cluster
history \cite{1997ApJ...487..529B}.

When the CRs interact with ambient gas protons, it results in the
production of both charged and neutral pions that decay into
electrons, neutrinos, and gamma-rays. The production of these
secondaries depend both on the gas and CR densities in the cluster,
where the CR density roughly trace the gas outside the core regime and
is slightly enhance in the center. This density scaling implies that
clusters are great targets for Cherenkov telescopes with a high
sensitivity for the central parts of close by clusters. Detecting the
cluster gamma-ray emission is crucial in this respect as it
potentially provides the unique and unambiguous evidence of CR
populations in clusters through observing the $\pi^0$ bump at about
100~MeV in the spectra. We adopt the spectrally and spatially
universal gamma-ray model developed by Pinzke \& Pfrommer
\cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} to estimate the emission from decaying
$\pi^0$:s that dominates over the inverse Compton emission from
primary and secondary electrons above 100~MeV in clusters. The
gamma-ray formalism was derived from high resolution simulations of
clusters of galaxies that included radiative hydrodynamics, star
formation, supernova feedback, and followed CR physics using a novel
formulation that trace the most important injection and loss processes
self-consistently while accounting for the CR pressure in the equation
of motion
\cite{2008A&A...481...33J,2007A&A...473...41E,2006MNRAS.367..113P}.
We note that the overall normalization of the CR and gamma-ray
distribution scales with the maximum acceleration efficiency at
structure formation shock waves. Following recent observations at
supernova remnants \cite{2009Sci...325..719H} as well as theoretical
studies \cite{2005ApJ...620...44K}, we adopt a realistic value of this
parameter and assume that 50\% of the dissipated energy at strong
shocks is injected into CRs while this efficiency rapidly decreases
for weaker shocks \cite{2007A&A...473...41E}.
 

\subsection{Particle physics}

\subsubsection{Leptophilic models}
\label{sect:LP}
Sommerfeld enhancement, electron spectra

\subsubsection{Supersymetric dark matter}
neutralino, benchmark models, continuum emission, electron spectra 

\subsubsection{Final state radiation}
The photon spectrum from resulting from FSR is universal with only a
weak dependence of the underlying particle physics model. The photon
yield from this process is given by (see
e.g. \cite{2008JHEP...01..049B})
\begin{equation}
\frac{\dd N_{X \bar{X}}}{\dd x} \approx \frac{\alpha Q_X^2}{\pi}
\mathcal{F}_X(x) \log\left[\frac{4 m_\chi^2\left(1-x\right)}{m_X^2}\right]\,.
\end{equation}
Here, the normalized photon energy $x=\eg/m_\chi c^2$, $\alpha =
e^2/\hbar c$ is the fine-structure constant, $Q_X^2$ and $m_X$ the
charge and mass of the particle $X$, respectively. The function
$\mathcal{F}_X(x)$ depends on the spin of the final state and is given
by
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_\rmn{fermion}(x) = \frac{1+\left(1-x\right)^2}{x}\,
\end{equation}
for fermions. 


\subsection{Radiative processes}

\subsubsection{Inverse Compton}
The source function of inverse Compton emission resulting from DM
annihilating is given by
\begin{equation}
  q_{\rm IC}\left(E_\gamma, r\right) = \int
  \dd E_\e\, \frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd E_\e} 
  P_{\rm IC}\left(E_\gamma,E_\e\right) ,
  \label{eq:ICemiss}
\end{equation}
where $P_{\rm IC}$ is derived by convolving the IC cross-section with
the differential target photon number density:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:KN_spec}
P_\rmn{IC} &=&
\frac{3\sigma_\rmn{T}m^2_\e c^5}{4E_\e^2}
\int\frac{n_\rmn{ph}(\eph)\dd \eph}{\eph}\nonumber \\
&\times&\left[2q
  \ln{q}+(1+2q)(1-q)+ \frac{1}{2}\frac{\left(\Gamma_\e q\right)^2}
     {1+\Gamma_\e q}\left(1-q\right)\right]\,,\nonumber \\
&&
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_\e=\frac{4\eph E_\e}{\left(m_\e c^2\right)^2}\,,\qquad \rmn{and} \qquad  
q=\frac{\eg}{\Gamma_\e(E_\e-\eg)}\,.
\end{equation}
We account for two major contributions to the radiative background
field $n_\ph$; the IR and UV light coming from emitting dust and
starlight where $n_\ph\equiv\frac{\dd^2 N_\ph^\clu}{\dd V \,\dd
  \eph}(\eph,r)= \frac{u_\iruv^\clu(\eph,r)}{\eph^2}$ and
$u_\iruv^\clu(\eph,r)$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:E_IR_UV}). We model the
CMB photon spectrum as a photon gas that is isotropically distributed and
follows a black body spectrum with temperature $T$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:photon_gas}
  n_\rmn{ph}(\eph) = \frac{\dd^2 N_\ph}{\dd V \,\dd \eph} =
  \frac{1}{\pi^2(\hbar c)^3}\frac{\eph^2}{\exp(\eph/k_\B T)-1}\,.
\end{equation}
Here the the typical energy of a photon before scattering is given by
$<E_\ph>=\epsilon_\ph/n_\ph\approx\,2.70 k_\B T$, where $n_\ph$ and
$\epsilon_\ph$ are the number- and energy-density derived by
integrating $n_\ph(E_\ph)$ and $E_\ph n_\ph(\eph)$ over the photon
energy $\eph$, respectively.

The equilibrium spectrum of the electrons plus positrons in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:ICemiss}) is given by $\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd E_\e}$ and
derived from the CRe diffusion equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:CRdiffusion}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd E_\e}\right) = 
&\nabla& \left[D\left(E_\e,\bx\right)\nabla\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd E_\e}\right] + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial E_\e}
\left[b\left(E_\e,\bx\right) \frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd E_\e}\right]
 \nonumber \\
&+& Q(E_\e,\bx)\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $D(E_\e,\bx)$ the diffusion coefficient and $b(E_\e,\bx)$ the
electron energy loss term. The source function $Q(E_\e,\bx)$ shows
the number of particles produced per unit time, energy and volume
element that are produced at the position $\bx$:
\begin{equation}
Q(E_\e,r)=\sum_f\frac{\dd N_\e^f}{\dd E_\e}(E_\e) B_f \Gamma(r)\,.
\end{equation}
The subscript $f$ ...(see cola), and $B_f$ is the branching factor.
Here $\frac{\dd N_\e^f}{\dd E_\e}$ denote the differential number of
electrons plus positrons resulting from an annihilation event. For
neutralinos annihilating directly into an electron and positron we
model the differential spectrum with $\frac{\dd N_\e^f}{\dd E_\e}=
2\delta(E_\e-m_\chi c^2)$. We use DarkSUSY to compute both the spectra
when neutralinos annihilate directly into a $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ in
the leptophilic model as well as in the four BM models where a
fraction of the annihilating neutralinos is converted into electrons
and positrons (see \cite{2009JCAP...01..016B} and references therein,
also see fit).  

The electrons and positrons loose their energy on a timescale that is
shorter than the diffusive timescale in the ICM of galaxy clusters for
CRe energies above MeV (CHECK). Hence, we neglect the first term of
the r.h.s. in Eq.~\ref{eq:CRdiffusion}, and derive an expression for
the equilibrium number density:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd E_\e}}\left(E_\e, r \right) &=&
 \frac{1}{b(E_\e, r)} \int_{E_\e}^{\mx c^2} \dd E_\e' \, 
  Q(E_\e', r),
\label{eq:nds}\\
b(E_\e,r) &=& \tilde{b}
\left[\frac{B^2_{\rm CMB}}{8\pi}+\frac{B^2(r)}{8\pi}+u_\iruv(r)\right] E_\e^2\,,
\\\tilde{b}&=&\frac{4\sigma_{\rm T}c}{3(m_{\rm e}c^2)^2}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Here we have included three main loss processes for the electrons;
$B_{\rm CMB}=3.24(1+z)^2\mu {\rm G}$ denotes the equivalent field
strength of the CMB, we parameterize the magnetic field of the galaxy
cluster by $B(r) = 3\mu\rmn{G} \,[n_{\rm e}(r)/n_{\rm e}(0)]^{0.7}$,
which follows from flux frozen magnetic fields. In the following
subsection we derive a semi-analytic formula that estimates the
energy density of the dust and starlight component $u_\iruv(r)$
given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:E_IR_UV}).

{\it IC -- dust and starlight}\\
Galaxy clusters are typically characterized by the hot gas in the ICM
and the collection of gravitationally bound galaxies. The emission in
the IR and UV wavelengths emerge from dust and starlight in both the
galaxies and the ICM (e.g. \cite{2006ApJ...648L..29P} and
\cite{2009MNRAS.399.1694G}). Most of this radiation leaks out from the
galaxy into the ICM, which explains the very similar spectral shape
for these wavelengths. We use the light from galactic dust and
starlight that is emitted in the IR and UV band and is accurately
measured for the ISM \cite{2006ApJ...648L..29P}. We model these
spectra through a fit to the galactic spectra presented in
\cite{2006ApJ...648L..29P}. We extract the spatial cluster profile of
the emission from a stacked analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) data at the redshift $\sim 0.25$
\cite{2005MNRAS.358..949Z}. Finally, we derive the normalization for
the emission from the galaxy cluster using the IR to X-ray luminosity
relation presented in the IR cluster luminosity analysis
\cite{2008A&A...490..547G}.

{\it Spectra -- galactic} \\
best fit, IR with a power-law function, UV with three power laws,
similar to Porter, vary normalization to account for uncertainties,
taken at $r=0$ in the galaxy
\begin{eqnarray}
  \eph^2\frac{\dd^2 N_\ph^\gal}{\dd \eph \dd V}
  &\equiv& u_\iruv^\gal(\eph) \nonumber \\ 
  &=& u_\rmn{ir}^\gal(\eph) +  u_\rmn{uv}^\gal(\eph)  \nonumber \\ 
  \\
  u_\rmn{uv}^\gal(\eph) &=& \frac{23\,\rmn{eV}}{\rmn{cm}^3} 
  \left(\frac{1.23\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{1.9} \nonumber \\
  &\times&\left[1+\left(\frac{2.04\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{20}\right]
  ^{-\frac{1.9}{20}}\nonumber \\
  &\times& \left[1+\left(\frac{0.78\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{20}\right]^{-\frac{2.6}{20}} \\
  u_\rmn{ir}^\gal(\eph) &=& 
  \frac{40\,\rmn{eV}}{\rmn{cm}^3} 
  \left(\frac{0.0144\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{4.9}\nonumber \\
  &\times& \left[1+\left(\frac{0.0144\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{1.9}\right]^{-4.9}\,,
\end{eqnarray}


{\it Spatial distribution - galaxy cluster}\\
 Instead of modelling the surface brightness with a de Vauocouleurs
 with the addition of a power law, we use a double beta profile model
 for simplicity of deprojection.

\begin{equation}
 S(\rmn{mag}\,\rmn{arcsec}^{-2}) = 
\mathcal{M}_\odot+21.572-2.5\rmn{log}_{10}S(L_\odot\,\rmn{pc}^{-2})
\end{equation}
\cite{2010...book} where the sun's absolute magnitude in the red ban is given by
$\mathcal{M}_\odot=27.1$ \cite{2000asqu.book..339L}, and the luminosity
of the sun by $L_\odot=3.85\,10^{33} \rmn{erg}\,\rmn{s}^{-1}$.

surface brightness double $\beta$ models
\begin{equation}
S_\mathrm{IR} (r_\bot)= \sum_{i=1}^2 \,S_i\, 
\left[1 + \left( \frac{r_\bot}{r_{\mathrm{c}_i}}\right)^2\right]
^{-3\beta_i + 1/2},
\label{double_beta}
\end{equation}
where we found the following values as the best fit,
\begin{eqnarray}
 S_1&=&1.4\times10^{-5}\,\rmn{erg}\,\rmn{cm}^{-2}\,\rmn{s}^{-1},\,
r_{\mathrm{c}_1}=210\,\rmn{kpc},\,
\beta_1=0.44\nonumber\\
 S_2&=&6.0\times10^{-3}\,\rmn{erg}\,\rmn{cm}^{-2}\,\rmn{s}^{-1},\,
r_{\mathrm{c}_2}=2.8\,\rmn{kpc},\,
\beta_2=0.45\nonumber\\
\label{fit_spatial_IR}
\end{eqnarray}
%\begin{eqnarray}
% S = 1.8\times10^{-5}\left(1+\left(\frac{R}{0.4\,\rmn{Mpc}}\right)^{-2.4}+
% 3\times10^{-3}\left(1+\left(\frac{R}{0.004\,\rmn{Mpc}}\right)^{4.1}\right)^{-0.4}
%\end{eqnarray}

deprojection
\begin{eqnarray}
  j(r)  = \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{S_i}{2\pi\,r_{\mathrm{c}_i}}\,
  \frac{6 \beta_i - 1}{\left(1 + r^2/r^2_{\mathrm{c}_i}\right)^{3\beta_i}}\,
  \mathcal{B}\left(\frac{1}{2},3\beta_i\right)\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathcal{B}(a,b)$ denotes the beta-function (abrahamovich and
stegun).  (Pfrommer and ensslin 2003)


{\it Normalization}\\
The spatial and spectral part of the IR and UV have an arbitrary
normalization where the specific energy density is given by
$u_\iruv^\clu(\eph, r) \propto u_\iruv^\gal(\eph)\,j(r)/j(0)$. We fix the
unitless normalization $N$ using the total IR energy
($E_{\ir,\vir}$) within $\rvir$
\begin{eqnarray} 
  E_{\ir,\vir} &=& L_\ir \frac{\rvir}{c} \nonumber \\
  &=&N\int_{\rvir} \int_{\ir} \,\frac{j(r)}{j(0)} 
  \frac{u_\ir^\gal(\eph)}{\eph}\,\dd V\dd \eph\,,\nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}
where we in the first equality sign approximate the total energy of
the IR photons within $\rvir$ with the IR luminosity $L_\ir$
\cite{2008A&A...490..547G} times the typical timescale it takes for a
photon to propagate through the cluster (we assume that the cluster is
optically thin). From \cite{2008A&A...490..547G} we derive the
following luminosity scaling relation, $L_\ir=10^{21.7}\times
(L_\rmn{X}/\rmn{erg\,s}^{-1})^{0.53}\,\rmn{erg\,s}^{-1}$, where
$L_\rmn{X}$ is the X-ray luminosity within $\rvir$.


{\it Energy density}\\
The energy density from starlight and dust in al galaxy cluster is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:E_IR_UV}
u_\iruv^\clu(r) &=& \int \dd \eph \frac{\dd^2 N_\ph^\clu}{\dd \eph \dd V}\,\eph
=\int \dd \eph \frac{u_\iruv^\clu(\eph, r)}{\eph}
\nonumber \\
&=&  N\frac{j(r)}{j(0)} \int \dd \eph \frac{u_\iruv^\gal(\eph)}{\eph}\,. \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}



\del{In this section we present the formalism for the different
galaxy cluster emission components and show their contribution to the
total dark matter gamma-ray spectrum. We account for the emission
radiated both by final state radiation and inverse Compton where we
allow for upscattering through CMB, starlight, and dust.}




%Using a typical
%X-ray luminosity of $L_\rmn{X}=10^{44}\,\rmn{erg\,s}^{-1}$ results in a
%IR energy density
%$N\,E_\IR\,f_\rmn{tot}(E_\IR)\,j(20\,\rmn{kpc})=u_\IR\simeq 4\,\rmn{erg\,

  observations CITE. The total hybrid profile shown by the red solid
  line represent the best fit to the data, where the fitted individual
  density components are shown by the black dotted lines. The blue
  solid line show the single beta density profile inferred from the
  HIFLUGCS catalogue. Due to insufficient sensitivity to the outer part
  in the plotted data, we infer the outer slope found in the HIFLUGCS
  catalogue.}

\caption{\it Comparing the flux from clusters in the extended HIFLUGCS
  catalogue. We show the energy integrated gamma-ray flux induced by
  CRs for the 106 clusters included in the extended HIFLUGCS
  catalogue. The fluxes are calculated within $\rvir$, and are derived
  using a single beta profile for each cluster's gas density profile
  (see text for details). The upper panel show the energy integrated
  flux above 100~MeV (left side) and above 100~GeV (right side), both
  as a function of HIFLUGCS cluster ID. The name of the eight
  brightest clusters are written out. The lower panel show the
  relative difference between the gamma-ray flux predicted by
  mass-luminosity scaling relations compared to the flux computed
  using the semi-analytically model CITE The name of the
  clusters with the largest offset are printed out, which correlate
  with cool core clusters.}
