\section{Introduction}

Dark matter has been searched for in direct detection experiments
\cite{Pato:2010zk}, at accelerators
\cite{Ellis:2001hv,Baer:2006ff,Khachatryan:2011tk} and also in
indirect detection experiments looking for signals in the cosmic-ray
spectra of antiprotons, positrons, neutrinos and all of the
electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays
\cite{Bergstrom:2009ib}. So far, the improvements in direct detection
sensitivity have put this method into focus, but the situation may
change considerably the coming few years as the CERN LHC experiments
collect data, and new gamma-ray detectors are being planned, such as
the CTA \cite{Consortium:2010bc}. In fact, it has recently been
pointed out \cite{Bergstrom:2010gh} that a dedicated ground-based
gamma-ray detector would have potential that goes far beyond that of
the other methods, depending on presently unknown parameters in the
particle physics models for dark matter.


Among the astrophysical systems which will be very interesting to
detect, and study, with coming gamma-ray detectors (Fermi, HESS,
MAGIC, VERITAS, and eventually large detectors like CTA) belong galaxy
clusters. The most promising directions in which to search for a
gamma-ray annihilation signal (from the annihilation process itself,
and also the accompanying bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton
components coming from charged particles produce in the annihilations)
are basically three:

1. The galactic centre (g.c.). This is where all numerical simulations
of cold dark matter predict the highest density. However, the detailed
dark matter density in the very central part is difficult to predict,
due a to a possibly very complicated interplay between baryons, dark
matter, and the central galactic black hole. Also, it is a very
crowded region with many gamma-ray sources like pulsars and other
supernova recants, which have to be subtracted from the data to
extract the dark matter induced signal. In fact, there is a recent
claim of an indication of a relatively light dark matter particle
contribution to the gamma-ray flux from the
g.c. \cite{2010arXiv1010.2752H}, but other hypotheses seem to work at
least as well \cite{2010arXiv1012.5839B}.

2. The dwarf spheroidal galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, like Segue-1,
Ursa Minor, Draco, Sagittarius, Sculptor, Carina or Willman-1
\cite{2009JCAP...01..016B,2010ApJ...720.1174A,2010JCAP...01..031S,2010JCAP...01..031S}. The
problem here is that the nature of many of these small, dark
matter-dominated galaxies is not entirely clear, and the velocity
dispersion estimates are based on rather small numbers of stars. Tidal
disruption and confusion with star clusters are other
complications. Thus the dark matter density profile is very uncertain
for most of them. Nonetheless, by stacking the data together from many
dwarf spheroidals these uncertainties can be made less severe, and
preliminary results from Fermi-LAT shows this method to give quite
promising results \cite{garde}.

3. Galaxy clusters. This possibility has been less studied, however we
noted in a previous Letter \cite{2009PhRvL.103r1302P} that the are
certain advantages that work in favour of this possible target for
gamma-ray detection of dark matter annihilation.  Galaxy clusters
constitute the most massive objects in our Universe that are forming
today. This causes their DM subhalo mass function to be less affected
by tidal stripping compared to galaxy sized halos that formed long
ago.  The annihilation luminosities of the DM halo component for
e.g. the Virgo cluster and the Draco dwarf scales in a way (see
\cite{2009PhRvL.103r1302P}) that the ratio of gamma-ray luminosities
from the smooth components is around 4, in favour of Virgo. In
addition, there may be a further enhancement due to substructure,
which to a large extent should be unaffected by tidal disruption, at
least in the outer regions.  According to a recent estimate
\cite{2011MNRAS.410.2309G}, more massive haloes tend to have a larger
mass fraction in subhalos.  For example, cluster size haloes typically
have 7.5 per cent of the mass within $r_{200}$ in substructures of
fractional mass larger than $10^{-5}$, which is 25 per cent higher
than galactic haloes \footnote{All halo masses and length scales in
  this paper are scaled to the currently favored value of Hubble's
  constant, $H_0 = 70\, \rm{km~s}^{-1}\,\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We define the
  virial mass $\mvir$ and virial radius $\rvir$ as the mass and radius
  of a sphere enclosing a mean density that is 200 times the critical
  density of the Universe $\rho_{\rm{cr}}$.}.

For a satellite dwarf galaxy, however, once it is accreted by the
Milky Way, the outer regions are severely affected by tidal
stripping. The longer a satellite has been part of our Galaxy, and the
closer it comes to the center during its pericentral passage, the more
material is removed \cite{2004MNRAS.355..819G}.

In this paper, we will investigate in some more detail the potential
of several of the most promising galaxy clusters to yield an
annihilation gamma-ray yield which could be observable with present
and planned gamma-ray detectors.

For previous work related to dark matter in clusters, see, e.g.,
\cite{2006A&A...455...21C,2009PhRvD..80b3005J}.

($\mvir=2.1\times10^{14}\,\msun$) \cite{} as the prime targets for DM
observations, Perseus ($\mvir=7.7\times10^{14}\,\msun$) for CR induced

\section{Theory}
\label{sect:theory}

\subsection{Astrophysics}
\label{sect:AP}

The differential photon flux within a given solid angle $\Delta
\Omega$ along a line-of-sight (los) is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dflux}
\frac{\dd \fg}{\dd \eg} \equiv \frac{\dd^3 \ngamma}{\dd A \,\dd t\, \dd
  \egamma} = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Delta\Omega} \dd\psi \sin\psi \frac{\dd \sg}{\dd \eg}(\psi,\eg)\,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dtildeflux}
\frac{\dd \sg}{\dd \eg}(\psi,\eg) = \int_{\Delta\Omega} \dd\Omega \int_{\rm los}
\dd l\, q_{\rm sum}\left(\eg,r\right)\Lambda(\theta)\,,
\end{equation}
and $\sg(\psi, >\eg)$ denotes the surface brightness above the photon
energy $\eg$.  The integration along the line-of-sight $l$, in the
direction $\psi$ that the detector is pointing, is parameterized such
that the radius of the source $r=\sqrt{l^2+D^2-2Dl\cos\Psi}$, where
$D$ is the distance to the source from the galactic center and
$\cos\Psi\equiv\cos\theta\cos\psi-\cos\varphi\sin\theta\sin\psi$. The
angular integration $\dd \Omega= \sin\theta\dd \theta \,\dd \varphi$
is performed over a cone centered around $\psi$ and the opening angle
$\Delta \Omega$ is typically taken to be a few times the point spread
function (PSF) $\psf$. The limited angular resolution results in a
probability that a photon coming from a direction $\psi$' is instead
reconstructed to a direction $\psi$, where the underlying probability
distribution follow a Gaussian:
\begin{equation}
\Lambda(\theta)=\frac{1}{2\pi\psf^2}
\,\rmn{exp}\left[-\frac{\theta^2}{2\psf^2}\right]\,,
\quad \rmn{where}\quad \theta=\psi'-\psi \,.
\end{equation}
We denote the total source function by $q_{\rm sum}(\eg,r)$, where we
include contributions from five main processes; leptophilic DM
annihilating to $\mu^+/\mu^-$ decaying to $\rm{e}^+/\rm{e}^-$ pairs
that up-scatter background photons (IC), leptophilic DM emitting final
state radiation (FSR), DM benchmark models where neutralino
annihilations generate electrons that up-scatter background photons
(BM-IC) and emit a continuum as well as final state radiation
(BM-Cont), and CR induced $\pi^0$:s decaying into gamma-rays. The
source function is given by
\begin{equation}
q_\rmn{sum} (\eg,r) = q_{\pi^0-\gamma}(\eg,r)+
\sum_i \,q_{\rmn{sm},i}(\eg,r)\,\B_{\rmn{tot},i}(\sigv,r)
\end{equation}
where the subscript $i$ runs over the gamma-ray producing DM
channels. The differential CR to gamma-ray source function is denoted
by $q_{\pi^0-\gamma}(\eg,r)$, where we refer the reader to
Sect.~\ref{sect:CRs} and \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} for further
details. The total differential boost factor for DM is the product of
enhancement factors from SFE $\B_\sfe(\sigv)$ (see
Sect.~\ref{sect:LP}) and from substructure enhancement over the smooth
halo contribution $\B_{\sub,i}(r) = 1+q_\sub(r)/q_{\rmn{sm},i}(r)$
(see Sect.~\ref{sect:subst}) and is denoted by
$\B_{\rmn{tot},i}(r,\sigv) = \B_\sfe(\sigv)\,\B_{\sub,i}(r)$. The DM
source function from the smooth halo for each process is written on
the form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:q_sm}
q_{\rmn{sm},i} (\egamma,r) = \sum_j
\frac{\dd \ngammaj}{\dd E_\gamma} \Gamma_j(r)\,.
\end{equation}
Here the annihilation rate density is given by 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ann_rate}
\Gamma_j(r) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\rho(r)}{\mx}\right)^2 
\, \sigmaannv_j\,
\end{equation}
where the subscript $j$ runs over all kinematically allowed gamma-ray
producing channels each with the spectrum $\frac{\dd
  \ngammaj}{\dd\eg}$ and annihilation cross-section $\sigmaannv_j$. We
denote the DM mass with $\mx$ and the DM density profile with
$\rho(r)$. Typically the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density
profile provide a good fit to both the observed and simulated
clusters. It can be considered as a special case of the 5-parameter profile:
\begin{equation}
\rho(r) = \frac{\rho_\s}{\left(r/r_\s+\right)^\gamma
  \left[1+\left(r/r_\s\right)^\alpha\right]^\delta}\,,\quad
\delta=\frac{\beta-\gamma}{\alpha}\,,
\label{eq:rho_nfw}
\end{equation}
where a cuspy NFW profile is given by
$(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)=(1,3,1)$. The scaling radius is given by $r_\s$
and the characteristic density by $\rhos=(\Delta\rhoc/3)\,
c^3/(\log(1+c)-(c/(1+c)))$, where the halo mass dependent
concentration parameter $c$ is derived from a power-law fit to
cosmological simulations with $\mvir \gtrsim 10^{10} \msun$
\cite{2008MNRAS.391.1940M},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cfit}
  c=3.56 \times \left(\frac{\mvir}{10^{15}\,\msun}\right)^{-0.098}\,.
\end{equation}
This mass scaling agrees well with \cite{2009ApJ...707..354Z} for
cluster-mass halos after converting the concentration definitions
according to \cite{2003ApJ...584..702H}. In this work we choose to
model the DM density by an Einasto density profile
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm ein}(r) = \rho_{-2}\,\exp\left\{-\frac{2}{\alpha}
  \left[\left(\frac{r}{r_{-2}}\right)^\alpha -1 \right] \right\},\,
\alpha=0.17 \,,
\end{equation}
that is slightly shallower in the center than the conventional
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, but provide a better fit to
simulated DM halos \cite{2010MNRAS.402...21N}. We denote the density
where the profile has a slope of $-2$ by $\rho_{-2}$, and the radius
by $r_{-2}$. Assuming that all the flux from an NFW profile originate
from within the scale radius $\rs=\rvir/c$, and all the flux from an
Einasto profile originate within $r_{-2}=\rvir/c$, it follows that
$\rho_{-2} = \rhos/4$. The virial radius $\rvir$ of a halo is defined
to be the radius at which the mean density within is a factor
$\Delta=200$ times the critical density $\rhoc$ of the universe.


\subsubsection{Substructures}
\label{sect:subst}
High-resolution DM only simulations of Milky Way (MW) type halos find
substantial amount of substructures in the periphery of DM halos,
while the substructures in the center are erased due to dynamical
disruption. Since the rate of which DM is annihilating depends on the
density squared, the resulting flux is boosted compared to the smooth
density distribution. Recent simulations suggest a flux enhancement
from substructures of the order of ten up to a few 100
\cite{2008MNRAS.391.1685S, 2008JPhCS.125a2008K} for a MW size
halo. Using the Aquarius simulations \cite{2008Natur.456...73S}, we
fit \footnote{Our approach of fitting the scaling behavior of
  $\rmn{L_{sub}}(<r)$ directly from numerical simulations
  self-consistently accounts for the radial dependence of the
  substructure concentration \cite{2008MNRAS.391.1685S}.} to the
luminosity from smooth substructures (i.e. substructures within
substructures are not included) inside radius $r$. The best fit is
given by
\begin{equation}
  {\rm L_{sub}}(<r)= 0.76\,C_1\,C_2(\mvir)\,{\rm L_{200sm}}\,x^{0.95
    \displaystyle{x}^{-0.27}}\,,
  \label{eq:LSub}
\end{equation}
where ${\rm L_{200sm}}$ is the luminosity from the smooth halo without
substructures within $\rvir$ and $x=
\left(\frac{r}{\rvir}\right)$. The first normalization constant is
derived from the simulations:
\begin{equation}
  C_1=\left(\frac{M_{\rm res,sim}}{M_{\rm lim}}\right)^{0.226}\,,
   \label{eq:C1}
\end{equation}
where $M_{\rm res,sim}=10^5\msun$ is the minimum subhalo mass in the
MW simulation, and $M_{\rm lim}$ the free streaming mass. Here we
assume that the power-law scaling relation in Eq.~(\ref{eq:C1}) is
valid down to the minimum mass of DM halos, which is conventionally in
the cold dark matter universe
\cite{2001PhRvD..64h3507H,2005JCAP...08..003G} taken to be
$10^{-6}\msun$. Note that potentially the power-law could flatten
towards smaller mass scales although current simulations show no hits
of such a behavior and in addition we are approaching the asymptotic
behavior in the power spectrum on these scales(CHECK). For DM halos
more (less) massive than the MW we expect a larger (smaller) boost
from substructures, simply because of the larger (smaller) mass range
down to the minimum mass $M_\rmn{lim}$. We capture this halo mass
dependence with the second normalization in Eq.~(\ref{eq:LSub}):
\begin{equation}
C_2(\mvir)=\left(\frac{\mvir}{M_{\rm 200sim}}\right)^{0.226}\,,
 \label{eq:C2}
\end{equation}
where $M_{\rm 200sim}=1.9\times10^{12}\msun$ is the mass of the MW
halo in the simulation \cite{2008Natur.456...73S}. 

Recent detailed galaxy cluster observations find a core like density
profile with an inner slope of $\beta=0.6$, where $\beta\gtrsim 1$ can
be ruled out to a $>95$\% confidence \cite{2011ApJ...728L..39N}. This
finding is hard to reconcile with simulations that typically prefere a
steeper central profile. The different density profiles have a large
impact on the luminosity from annihilating DM, although the details of
the density profile can be neglected compared to the dominating boost
from substructures. In Fig.~\ref{fig:radial_lum} we compare the radial
dependence of the accumulative luminosity from different smooth
cluster density profiles to the substructure boosted luminosity at
different mass scales. We recalculate the density contrast for the
core like density profile $\rhos$ and rescale the concentration
parameter in Eq.~(\ref{eq:cfit}) with $300/160$
\cite{2011ApJ...728L..39N} to account for the more centralized scale
radius in a core like cluster. The emission coming from the core
compared to a cuspy like density profile is about 30\% larger within
$\rvir$. This difference is build up within 10\% of $\rvir$
(i.e. close to $r_\rmn{s}$). The emission from an Einasto density
profile is about 50\% larger than the cuspy NFW profile in the
periphery of the cluster, where the difference is mainly build up at a
few percent of $\rvir$. The substructure boosted luminosities is
neglible in the center of halos, but integrated out to $\rvir$ the
boost is about; 10 for dwarf galaxies, $10^2$ for galaxies, and $10^3$
for galaxy clusters.
\begin{figure}%[t]
 \includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{figures/dens.prof.eps}
\caption{\it Radial dependence of various luminosity
  contributions. The solid lines show the accumulative smooth
  luminosity from a cluster with the mass $\mvir=10^{15}\,\msun$ for
  three different density profiles; an Einasto profile with
  $\alpha=0.17$ (light blue), a cuspy NFW profile with $\beta=1.0$
  (dark blue), and a core NFW profile with $\beta=0.6$ (purple). The
  dashed lines show the accumulative luminosity from substructures for
  three different mass scales; an $\mvir=10^{15}\,\msun$ galaxy
  cluster (red), an $\mvir=10^{12}\,\msun$ galaxy (orange), and an
  $\mvir=10^{8}\,\msun$ dwarf galaxy (green). All luminosities have
  been normalized with the luminosity within $\rvir$ from a cuspy NFW
  profile. We have assumed the standard value for the limiting
  substructure mass of $10^{-6}\,\msun$. Note the large expected
  boost from substructures in clusters ($\sim1000$), and the relative
  small boost in dwarf galaxies ($\sim20$).}
 \label{fig:radial_lum}
\end{figure}

Even though the bulk of substructures have been erased in the central
regions of DM halos, a cluster in projection has a significant
enhancement due to substructures at a radius of just a few percent of
$\rvir$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:radial_emis} we show the luminosity
dominating radius for substructures and smooth density profiles, both
for three different mass scales. It clearly shows how that the main
contribution from the substructures is coming from outer parts of the
DM halos, while the main contribution from the smooth density profiles
peaks around the scale radius. NOT QUITE, ALSO FIGURE IS SHOWING DIFF
VOLUME, FAC 3 DIFFERENCE, WHAT DO WE REALLY LEARN FROM THE FIGURE

\subsubsection{Cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission}
\label{sect:CRs}
The formation process of a galaxy cluster is a very energetic
processes that induces both turbulence as well as frequently occurring
merging and accretion shocks. These processes are thought to
accelerate large quantities of relativistic non-thermal electrons and
protons to high energies. On smaller scales, such as galaxies, there
is convincing evidence of such non-thermal populations. Especially, in
the MW, the cosmic rays are observed directly as well as indirectly
through radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission. On larger scales of the
order of few 100 kpc up to Mpc, there are a vast number of
observations of radio emission coming from radio mini halos in the
center of cooling flow clusters, radio relics in the periphery of
clusters \cite{2004rcfg.proc..335K} as well smooth giant radio halos
that have been observed in more than 50 clusters
\cite{2003ASPC..301..143F,2008SSRv..134...93F}. Most of this observed
radio emission is expected to emerge from synchrotron emitting
cosmic-ray electrons whose precise origin in especially relics and
giant radio halos is still not settled. However, due to the smoothness
of the extended emission and the observed power-law slope it seems
quite natural that they are of hadronic origin. Especially since the
long cooling time of cosmic ray protons (CRs) allows for both an
extended and large population of CRs to build up over the cluster
history \cite{1997ApJ...487..529B}.

When the CRs interact with ambient gas protons, it results in the
production of both charged and neutral pions that decay into
electrons, neutrinos, and gamma-rays. The production of these
secondaries depend both on the gas and CR densities in the cluster,
where the CR density roughly trace the gas outside the core regime and
is slightly enhance in the center. This density scaling implies that
clusters are great targets for Cherenkov telescopes with a high
sensitivity for the central parts of close by clusters. Detecting the
cluster gamma-ray emission is crucial in this respect as it
potentially provides the unique and unambiguous evidence of CR
populations in clusters through observing the $\pi^0$ bump at about
100~MeV in the spectra. 

We adopt the spectrally and spatially universal gamma-ray model
developed by Pinzke \& Pfrommer \cite{2010MNRAS.409..449P} to estimate
the emission from decaying $\pi^0$:s that dominates over the inverse
Compton emission from primary and secondary electrons above 100~MeV in
clusters. The gamma-ray formalism was derived from high resolution
simulations of clusters of galaxies that included radiative
hydrodynamics, star formation, supernova feedback, and followed CR
physics using a novel formulation that trace the most important
injection and loss processes self-consistently while accounting for
the CR pressure in the equation of motion
\cite{2008A&A...481...33J,2007A&A...473...41E,2006MNRAS.367..113P}.
We note that the overall normalization of the CR and gamma-ray
distribution scales with the maximum acceleration efficiency at
structure formation shock waves. Following recent observations at
supernova remnants \cite{2009Sci...325..719H} as well as theoretical
studies \cite{2005ApJ...620...44K}, we adopt a realistic value of this
parameter and assume that 50\% of the dissipated energy at strong
shocks is injected into CRs while this efficiency rapidly decreases
for weaker shocks \cite{2007A&A...473...41E}.

\subsubsection{Supersymmetric dark matter}
neutralino, benchmark models, continuum emission, electron spectra 

\subsubsection{Final state radiation}
The photon spectrum from resulting from FSR is universal with only a
weak dependence of the underlying particle physics model. The photon
yield from this process is given by (see
e.g. \cite{2008JHEP...01..049B})
\begin{equation}
\frac{\dd N_{X \bar{X}}}{\dd x} \approx \frac{\alpha Q_X^2}{\pi}
\mathcal{F}_X(x) \log\left[\frac{4 m_\chi^2\left(1-x\right)}{m_X^2}\right]\,.
\end{equation}
Here, the normalized photon energy $x=\eg/m_\chi c^2$, $\alpha =
e^2/\hbar c$ is the fine-structure constant, $Q_X^2$ and $m_X$ the
charge and mass of the particle $X$, respectively. The function
$\mathcal{F}_X(x)$ depends on the spin of the final state and is given
by
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_\rmn{fermion}(x) = \frac{1+\left(1-x\right)^2}{x}\,
\end{equation}

\subsection{Radiative processes}
In this section we outline the basics of inverse Compton (IC)
emission. As target radiation fields we consider both cosmic microwave
background (CMB) photons, and the light from stars and dust (SD). We
derive a semi-analytic model from which we can estimate the SD
spectral and spatial distributions as a simple function of cluster
mass.

\subsubsection{Inverse Compton}
\label{sect:IC}
The standard IC source function is given by
\cite{1979rpa..book.....R}:
\begin{eqnarray}
  q_{\rmn IC}(\eg, r) &=&  \frac{\dd^3 N_\gamma}{\dd V\,\dd t\,\dd \eg} = 
 \frac{3}{4}c\,\sigma_\rmn{T}
\int\dd \eph \frac{n_\rmn{ph}(\eph)}{\eph}\nonumber\\
&\times& \int \dd \ee\,\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd \ee}(\ee,r)\,
 \frac{\left(m_\e c^2\right)^2}{\ee^2}G(\Gamma_\e,q)\,,\nonumber\\
  \label{eq:ICemiss}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\ee$ is the energy of the upscattering electrons and $\eph$ is
the energy of the background photon field. We represent the Thomson
cross-section with $\sigma_\rmn{T}$ and the full differential
Klein-Nishina (KN) cross-section is captured by
\cite{1970RvMP...42..237B}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:KN_spec}
G(\Gamma_\e,q) = 2q\ln{q}+(1+2q)(1-q)+ 
\frac{1}{2}\frac{\left(\Gamma_\e q\right)^2\left(1-q\right)}
     {1+\Gamma_\e q}\,,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_\e=\frac{4\eph \ee}{\left(m_\e c^2\right)^2}\,,\qquad \rmn{and} \qquad  
q=\frac{\eg}{\Gamma_\e\left(\ee-\eg\right)}\,.
\end{equation}
The full KN cross-section accounts for the less efficient energy
transfer between the photon and electron and results in a steepening
of the IC gamma-ray spectrum. In the low energy Thomson regime the IC
spectrum is given by $E_\gamma^{-(\alpha_\e-1)/2}$, however when
$\Gamma_\e \gg 1$ the IC spectrum steepens due to the KN suppression
to $\eg^{-\alpha_\e}\log(\eg)$ .

We account for two major contributions to the number density of
radiative background fields $n_\ph$; the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) photons and the infra-red (IR) to ultra-violet (UV) light
emitted by starlight and dust (SD). The number density for the SD is
given by $n_\ph\equiv\frac{\dd^2 N_\ph}{\dd V \,\dd
  \eph}(\eph,r)= \frac{u_\sd(\eph,r)}{\eph^2}$ where the SD
energy density $u_\sd(\eph,r)$ is given in Eq.~(\ref{eq:U_SD}). We
model the CMB photon spectrum as a photon gas that is isotropically
distributed and follows a black body spectrum with the temperature
$T=2.73\,$~K:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:photon_gas}
  n_\rmn{ph}(\eph) = \frac{\dd^2 N_\ph}{\dd V \,\dd \eph} =
  \frac{1}{\pi^2(\hbar c)^3}\frac{\eph^2}{\exp(\eph/k_\B T)-1}\,.
\end{equation}
Note that the typical energy of a black body photon before scattering
is given by $<\eph>=\epsilon_\ph/\tilde{n}_\ph\approx\,2.70 k_\B T$,
where $\tilde{n}_\ph$ and $\epsilon_\ph$ are the number- and
energy-density derived by integrating $n_\ph(\eph)$ and $\eph
n_\ph(\eph)$ over the photon energy $\eph$, respectively.

The electrons injected from annihilating DM also suffer from diffusive
and radiative losses. Hence we have to calculate the equilibrium
spectrum of the electrons plus positrons denoted by $\frac{\dd
  n_\e}{\dd \ee}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:ICemiss}). We derive this stationary
solution using the CR transport equation (neglecting convection and
re-acceleration effects):
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:CRdiffusion}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd \ee}\right) = 
&\nabla& \left[D\left(\ee,\bx\right)\nabla\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd \ee}\right] + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \ee}
\left[b\left(\ee,\bx\right) \frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd \ee}\right]
 \nonumber \\
&+& q_\e(\ee,\bx)\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $D(\ee,\bx)$ denotes the diffusion coefficient and $b(\ee,\bx)$
the energy loss term. The source function $q_\e(\ee,\bx)$ yields the
number of electrons and positrons produced per unit time, energy and
volume element at the position $\bx$:
\begin{equation}
q_\e(\ee,r)=\sum_f\frac{\dd N_{\e,f}}{\dd \ee}(\ee) B_f \Gamma_f(r) \,,
\end{equation}
where the annihilation rate density $\Gamma_f(r)$ is defined in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:ann_rate}). The sum runs over the kinematically allowed
annihilation final states $f$, each with a branching ratio $B_f$ and a
differential spectrum $\frac{\dd N_\e^f}{\dd \ee}$ that represents the
number of electrons plus positrons resulting from an annihilation
event. For neutralinos annihilating directly into electrons and
positrons we model the spectral distribution with $\frac{\dd
  N_\e^f}{\dd \ee}= 2\delta(\ee-m_\chi c^2)$. We use DarkSUSY to
compute both the spectra when neutralinos annihilate directly into a
$\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ in the leptophilic model as well as in the four BM
models where a fraction of the annihilating neutralinos is converted
into electrons and positrons (see Sect.~\ref{sect:PF} for further
details).
%(see \cite{2009JCAP...01..016B} and references therein,
%also see fit).  

The electrons and positrons loose their energy on a timescale that is
shorter than the diffusive timescale in the ICM of galaxy clusters for
CR electrons with $\ee \gtrsim\,$~MeV (CHECK). Hence, we neglect the
first term of the r.h.s. in Eq.~(\ref{eq:CRdiffusion}), and derive an
expression for the equilibrium number density:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\frac{\dd n_\e}{\dd \ee}}\left(\ee, r \right) &=&
 \frac{1}{b(\ee, r)} \int_{\ee}^{\mx c^2} \dd \ee' \, 
  Q(\ee', r),
\label{eq:nds}\\
b(\ee,r) &=& \tilde{b}
\left[\frac{B^2_{\rm CMB}}{8\pi}+\frac{B^2(r)}{8\pi}+u_\sd(r)\right] \ee^2\,,
\\\tilde{b}&=&\frac{4\sigma_{\rm T}c}{3(m_{\rm e}c^2)^2}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Here we include the three main radiative loss processes for the CR
electrons and positrons: (1) IC losses on CMB photons where the
equivalent field strength of the CMB is denoted by $B_{\rm
  CMB}=3.24(1+z)^2\mu\rmn{G}$. (2) Synchrotron losses on ambient
magnetic fields where we parameterize the magnetic field in the galaxy
cluster by $B(r) = 3\mu\rmn{G} \,[n_{\rm e}(r)/n_{\rm
    e}(0)]^{\alpha_\B}$, which follows from flux frozen magnetic
fields. We adopt a magnetic decline of $\alpha_\B=0.7$ in this
work. (3) IC losses on starlight and dust with an energy density
$u_\sd(r)$ given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:U_SD}), which we derive in the
following subsection.

{\it IC -- dust and starlight}\\ Galaxy clusters are typically
characterized by the hot gas in the ICM and the collection of
gravitationally bound galaxies. The emission in the IR and UV
wavelengths emerge from dust and starlight in both the galaxies and
the ICM (e.g. \cite{2006ApJ...648L..29P} and
\cite{2009MNRAS.399.1694G}). Much of the radiation leaks out from the
galaxy into the ICM, which give rise to similar spectral distributions
for the galaxies and the ICM in these wavelengths. Hence, we use the
accurately measured light from galactic dust and starlight for the ISM
to model the ICM. We characterize the spectra through a fit to the
galactic spectra presented in \cite{2006ApJ...648L..29P}. The spatial
distribution of the SD light in clusters is extracted from a stacked
emission analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data at the
redshift $\sim 0.25$ \cite{2005MNRAS.358..949Z}. Finally, we fix the
normalization for the light from stars and dust in an galaxy cluster
individually using using the IR to X-ray luminosity scaling relation
found in \cite{2008A&A...490..547G}. The X-ray luminosities for the
clusters used in this work are listed in the extended HIghest X-ray
FLUx Galaxy Cluster Sample (HIFLUGCS) \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R} from
the Rosat all-sky survey. Note that we have added the Virgo cluster to
the sample that we nevertheless refer to as extended HIFLUGCS
catalogue in the following.

{\it Spatial distribution -- stars and dust}\\ Our goal in this
section is to derive a simple spatial model for the distribution of
stars and dust in galaxy clusters. For this reason we use stacked
cluster observations by Sloan in the $r$-band that trace the stars. We
assume that the dust trace the stars in the clusters, which should be
accurate to the order of magnitude estimate that we are interested in
here. The stacked surface brightness profiles in
\cite{2005MNRAS.358..949Z} are measured at redshift $z \sim 0.25$ with
an average mass of the clusters of $4.0\times10^{13}\,\msun$. The
profiles are build up out of three components; diffuse intracluster
light (ICL), galaxies, and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the
center of clusters. However, the total volume overlap of the ISM to
the cluster is very small compared to the ICL- and BCG overlap with
the cluster, thus the relative contribution of the galaxies to the IC
emission is suppressed. To remove this bias we cut out the galaxies
that have been smoothed over the cluster in the stacked analysis. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:SD_spatial} we show the SDSS stacked brightness profiles
as well as the fitted profiles\footnote{The measured brightness is
  converted into units of $\rmn{erg}\,\rmn{s}^{-1}$ using
  \cite{2010...book} $S(\rmn{mag}\,''^{-2}) =
  \mathcal{M}_\odot+21.572-2.5\rmn{log}_{10}S(L_\odot\,\rmn{pc}^{-2})$,
  where the sun's absolute magnitude in the $r$-band is given by
  $\mathcal{M}_\odot=27.1$ \cite{2000asqu.book..339L} and the
  luminosity of the sun by $L_\odot=3.85\,10^{33}
  \rmn{erg}\,\rmn{s}^{-1}$.}. Our benchmark spatial model are show
with the solid black line, and include the contribution from the ICL
and BCG.

\begin{figure}%[t]
 \includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{figures/SB.photon.eps}
\caption{\it Spatial dependence of light from stars and dust. We show
  2D surface brightness profiles in the $r$-band ($\sim 1\,\ev$)
  obtained from stacked clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
  (SDSS) at the redshift $z \sim 0.25$ \cite{2005MNRAS.358..949Z}. The
  brightness profiles have been weighted with the $\rvir$ normalized
  area inside radius $r$, and trace the radial dependence of the
  luminosity from stars and galaxies. The crosses show the total
  observed star light including the diffuse intracluster (ICL), the
  galaxies, and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the center of
  the cluster. The diamonds denote the observed star light from the
  ICL and the BCG. The solid line show the fit to the data of the
  total light including the ICL, the BCG, and the galaxies, while the
  smooth component is represented by the dashed line that is fitted to
  only the ICL and the BCG.}
 \label{fig:SD_spatial}
\end{figure}

Instead of modelling the surface brightness with a de Vaucouleur
profile with the addition of a power-law, we use a double beta profile
model for simplicity of deprojection given by:
\begin{equation}
S_\sd (r_\bot)= \sum_{i=1}^2 \,S_i\, 
\left[1 + \left( \frac{r_\bot}{r_{\mathrm{c}_i}}\right)^2\right]
^{-3\beta_i + 1/2}\,,
\label{double_beta}
\end{equation}
where we found the following best fitted central brightness ($S_i$),
core radius ($r_{\mathrm{c}_i}$), and slope ($\beta_i$):
\begin{eqnarray}
 S_1&=&1.4\times10^{-5}\,\rmn{erg}\,\rmn{cm}^{-2}\,\rmn{s}^{-1},\,
r_{\mathrm{c}_1}=210\,\rmn{kpc},\,
\beta_1=0.44\nonumber\\
 S_2&=&6.0\times10^{-3}\,\rmn{erg}\,\rmn{cm}^{-2}\,\rmn{s}^{-1},\,
r_{\mathrm{c}_2}=2.8\,\rmn{kpc},\,
\beta_2=0.45\,.\nonumber\\
\label{fit_spatial_IR}
\end{eqnarray}
The 3D spatial profile is derived by deprojecting the surface
brightness in Eq.~(\ref{double_beta}) (see
e.g. \cite{2004A&A...413...17P} for details about the deprojection):
\begin{eqnarray}
  j(r)  = \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{S_i}{2\pi\,r_{\mathrm{c}_i}}\,
  \frac{6 \beta_i - 1}{\left(1 + r^2/r^2_{\mathrm{c}_i}\right)^{3\beta_i}}\,
  \mathcal{B}\left(\frac{1}{2},3\beta_i\right)\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathcal{B}(a,b)$ denotes the beta-function
\cite{1965hmfw.book.....A}.


{\it Spectral distribution -- stars and dust} \\ Our goal in this
section is to derive a simple spectral model for stars and dust in
galaxy clusters. Since the radiation from galaxies are expected to
leak out into the ICM, we expect similar spectral distributions, at
least to the order of magnitude that we are interested in here. Hence, we
use the IR to UV spectrum derived in \cite{2006ApJ...648L..29P} for a
MW type galaxy to characterize the spectral distribution of dust and
starlight in a cluster. Note, however, that we only keep the spectral
shape, and renormalize the spectral distribution using the luminosity
from stars and dust.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:SD_spectra} we show the SD spectral distribution
together with the CMB black-body distribution in a galaxy cluster,
both at the radius $r=0.071\rvir$ where the smooth energy density of
the SD light (see Fig.~\ref{fig:SD_Edens}) equals the energy density
of the CMB. We have renormalized both the spectral SD data and the
fitted SD spectra using the luminosity from stars and dust
individually (see below for further details about the
renormalization).
\begin{figure}%[t]
 \includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth]{figures/fit.porter.v2.eps}
\caption{\it Spectral dependence of radiation fields in a cluster of
  galaxies. The black dotted line in the left peak show the spectrum
  of CMB photons using a black body with a temperature of 2.73 K. The
  crosses in the middle and right peaks represent the measured spectra
  from stars and dust (SD), respectively, and are derived in
  \cite{2006ApJ...648L..29P} for a galaxy. We normalize the individual
  SD spectrum separately using the observed luminosity from SD in
  clusters. The SD luminosity is related to the cluster mass through
  Eq, where we use have used the mass $\mvir=4.0\,10^{13}\msun$ in
  this figure. Finally we renormalize the SD spectra to the radius
  $r=0.071\rvir$, where the smooth energy density of the SD light (see
  fig~\ref{fig:SD_Edens}) equals the energy density of the CMB. The
  red dashed lines show the fitted SD spectral model.}
 \label{fig:SD_spectra}
\end{figure}
We choose to fit the spectrum of the dust that peaks at about
$10^{-2}\,\ev$ with a double power-law, and the slightly wider
spectral distribution of the stars that peaks at about $1\,\ev$ with a
tipple power-law. We find the best fit spectra for the SD in a
cluster through:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \eph^2\frac{\dd^2 N_\ph}{\dd \eph \dd V}
  &\equiv& u_\sd(\eph) =  \sum_i N_i(\lx) u_i^\gal(\eph)\,,\nonumber \\ 
\rmn{where}\quad i&=&\{\rmn{stars,dust}\} \qquad \rmn{and}\\ 
% &=&  N_\dust(\lx) u_\dust^\gal(\eph) + N_\stars(\lx) u_\stars^\gal(\eph)  \nonumber \\ 
%  \\
  u_\stars^\gal(\eph) &=& \frac{23\,\rmn{eV}}{\rmn{cm}^3} 
  \left(\frac{1.23\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{1.9} \nonumber \\
  &\times&\left[1+\left(\frac{2.04\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{20}\right]
  ^{-\frac{1.9}{20}}\nonumber \\
  &\times& \left[1+\left(\frac{0.78\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{20}\right]^{-\frac{2.6}{20}}\,, \\
  u_\dust^\gal(\eph) &=& 
  \frac{40\,\rmn{eV}}{\rmn{cm}^3} 
  \left(\frac{0.0144\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{4.9}\nonumber \\
  &\times& \left[1+\left(\frac{0.0144\,\rmn{eV}}{\eph}\right)^{1.9}\right]^{-4.9}\,.
\end{eqnarray}


{\it Normalization}\\ HARD TO READ, TO MUCH DETAIL, MOVE TO APPENDIX?,
MABEY KEEP NORM CONSTATS AND A VERY SHORT SUMMARY?? The spatial and
spectral distribution functions of the light from stars and dust in a
cluster are both normalized with a constant determined from the
luminosity in each respective wavelength. The specific energy density
is given by
\begin{eqnarray} 
u_\sd(\eph, r) &=& \frac{j(r)}{j(0)}\,u_\sd(\eph) \nonumber\\
&=& \frac{j(r)}{j(0)}\,\sum_i N_i(\lx) u_i^\gal(\eph)\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where we fix the unitless normalization $N_i(\lx)$ using the total
energy of the light in stars and dust ($E_{i,\vir}$) within $\rvir$:
\begin{eqnarray} 
  E_{i,\vir} &=& L_i \frac{\rvir}{c} \nonumber \\
  &=&N_i(\lx)\int_{\rvir} \int_i \,\frac{j(r)}{j(0)} 
  \frac{u_i^\gal(\eph)}{\eph}\,\dd V\dd \eph\,,\nonumber \\
 &\rmn{for}&\qquad i=\{\rmn{stars,dust}\}\,.
\label{eq:E_SD}
\end{eqnarray}
Here we approximate the total energy of the photons within $\rvir$
with the luminosity $L_i$ \cite{2008A&A...490..547G} times the typical
timescale it takes for a photon to propagate through the cluster (we
assume that the cluster is optically thin). Once we estimated the SD
luminosities for a well representative cluster, we use a IR to X-ray
scaling relation to estimate the luminosity from an arbitrary cluster
with mass $\mvir$:
\begin{equation}
L=1.05\times10^{45}\,\rmn{erg\,s}^{-1}\,
\left(\frac{\lx}{10^{44}\rmn{erg\,s}^{-1}}\right)^{0.53}\,,
\label{eq:SD-X}
\end{equation}
where $\lx$ is the luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas within
$\rvir$.

The normalization constant for the star light [$N_\stars(\lx)$] is derived
in the following three steps: (1) We use the average apparent magnitude
in the $(r+i)$-band $m_{(r+i),0.25}\approx 15.5$
\cite{2005MNRAS.358..949Z} of a cluster with the average mass
$\mvir=4.0\times10^{13}\msun$ at a redshift $z=0.25$ to derive the
luminosity from the stars:
\begin{equation}
L_\stars=10^{\frac{m_\odot-m_{(r+i),0.25}}{2.5}}
\left(\frac{d_\clu}{d_\odot}\right)^2 L_\odot
\approx 7.1\times10^{44}\,\rmn{erg}\,\rmn{s}^{-1}\,,
\label{eq:L_star}
\end{equation}
where the apparent magnitude of the sun $m_\odot\approx -27.1$, the
distance to the sun $d_\odot=4.85\times10^{-6}\,\rmn{pc}$, the
luminosity of the sun $L_\odot=3.85\times10^{34}\,\rmn{erg\,s}^{-1}$,
and the distance to the cluster $d_\clu=1.26\times10^9\,\rmn{pc}$. (2)
We use the IR to X-ray scaling relation in Eq.~(\ref{eq:SD-X}) to find
a more general form of the luminosity from stars in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:L_star}) that is valid for an arbitrary cluster mass. The
cluster X-ray luminosities are found in the extended HIFLUGCS
catalogue \cite{2002ApJ...567..716R} to which we have added the Virgo
cluster. (3) The normalization constant for the stars is
determined from the above steps together with Eq.~(\ref{eq:E_SD})
where we integrate over the cluster volume and spectral distribution
of the stars. It is given by
\begin{equation}
 N_\stars(\lx) = 1.2\times10^{-9}\,
\left(\frac{\lx}{10^{44}\rmn{erg\,s}^{-1}}\right)^{0.53}\,.
\label{eq:N_stars}
\end{equation}
Note that since the luminosities include the contribution from
galaxies, we have integrated the spatial distribution including
galaxies to derive the normalization. Once the normalization is fixed,
the SD energy densities are derived from the spatial distribution
where galaxies have been excluded.

The normalization constant for the dust [$N_\dust(\lx)$] is derived in the
following four steps: (1) We use a cluster with the the average mass
$\mvir=4.0\times10^{13}\msun$ and estimate the X-ray luminosity from
the X-ray to mass scaling relations derived for the Representative
XMM-Newton Cluster Structure Survey (REXCESS) in
\cite{2009A&A...498..361P}:
\begin{equation}
\lx=1.18\times 10^{44}\,\rmn{erg\,s}^{-1}
\left(\frac{M_{200}}{10^{14}\msun}\right)^{1.81}\,,
\end{equation}
where we have used that $M_\rmn{200} \approx 1.58\,M_\rmn{500}$ for a
small cluster \footnote{We derive the factor 1.58 using
  $M_\rmn{200}/M_\rmn{500}$ for the clusters in the HIFLUGCS catalogue
  with a mass similar to $\mvir=4.0\times10^{13}\msun$ that we use to
  derive the luminosity from dust.}. (2) From the IR to X-ray scaling
relation in Eq.~(\ref{eq:SD-X}) we can now estimate calculate the
luminosity from the dust for a $\mvir=4.0\times10^{13}\msun$ cluster;
$L_\dust=4.7\times10^{44}\,\rmn{erg\,s}^{-1}$. (3) We generalize
Eq.~(\ref{eq:L_star}) to an arbitrary cluster mass using
Eq.~(\ref{eq:SD-X}) together with the cluster X-ray luminosities in
the extended HIFLUGCS catalogue. (4) The normalization constant for
the dust can now be determined from from the above steps together with
Eq.~(\ref{eq:E_SD}) where we integrate over the cluster volume and
spectral distribution of the dust. It is given by
\begin{equation}
 N_\dust(\lx) = 1.4\times10^{-9}\,
\left(\frac{\lx}{10^{44}\rmn{erg\,s}^{-1}}\right)^{0.53}\,.
\label{eq:N_stars}
\end{equation}
Note that since the luminosities include the contribution from
galaxies, we have integrated the spatial distribution including
galaxies to derive the normalization. Once the normalization is fixed,
the SD energy densities are derived from the spatial distribution
where galaxies have been excluded.

{\it Energy density}\\ The energy density from starlight and dust in
a galaxy cluster is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:U_SD}
u_\sd(r) &=& \int \dd \eph \frac{\dd^2 N_\ph}{\dd \eph \dd V}\,\eph
=\int \dd \eph \frac{u_\sd(\eph, r)}{\eph}
\nonumber \\
&=&  \frac{j(r)}{j(0)} \int \dd \eph \sum_i 
N_i(\lx) u_i^\gal(\eph)\,. \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:SD_Edens} we compare the energy densities from
different radiation fields in a galaxy cluster with the mass
$\mvir=4.0\times10^{13}\msun$. We use two different profiles for the
SD energy density, where the total includes the ICL, the BCG and all
the galaxies, while the galaxies are excluded in the smooth
contribution. We find that even for a cluster with a relative small
mass the energy density of the SD components dominates over the CMB
and the magnetic fields (with a central B field of 3~$\mu G$) within
about 10\% of $\rvir$. Outside this radius the CMB is dominating the
energy density of the cluster, hence the density of the magnetic
fields are always subdominant in the cluster and can safely be removed
from cluster IC calculations for reasonable central densities and
spectral index. Although, in this work we keep its contribution to the
total energy density for consistency.

 \caption{\it Spatial dependence of the energy density of radiation
